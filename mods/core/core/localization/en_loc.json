Parasoul's {hp} is one of them. Try a s.{hp} {seqs} s.{hp} combo now.",
 "ComboStageExp01": "Now that you know how to do Infinity Breakers, let's look at how they're triggered.\n\nThere are two systems used in Skullgirls to track combos: the Infinite Prevention System (IPS) and the Drama gauge.

 "ComboStageExp02": "Combo Stages\n\nThere are five stages to any combo in Skullgirls. Stage 1 consists of any attacks used when first jumping in on the opponent.\n\nStage 2 consists of the first chain of attacks in a combo when started on the ground or following the initial jump-in attacks.

 "ComboStageExp05": "Stage 3 is the next chain of attacks in the combo after Stage 2.\n\nIn a standard combo, this is typically the first chain of attacks in mid-air after you've launched the opponent and jumped up to continue the combo.\n\nStage 3 is where the Infinite Prevention System begins tracking the attacks you've used in each chain.\nIt's also the point from which all attacks start to add Drama to your opponent's Drama gauge.",
 "ComboStageExp06": "Stage 4 is the next chain of attacks in mid-air following Stage 3 before you land.\n\nJust like in Stage 3, attacks you've used in Stage 4 are tracked and each add a certain amount of Drama.",
 "ComboStageExp07": "Once you land after Stage 3 or Stage 4, or if you start a new chain after Stage 3 and are still on the ground, you will be in Stage 5. Stage 5 is the last Combo Stage.\n\nAny attacks used in Stage 5 will also be tracked and add Drama like in Stages 3 and 4, but now starting a new chain of attacks with one you've already used will trigger the Infinite Prevention System.",
 "ComboStageExp08": "That was a lot!\n\nLet's try out a combo that takes you all the way from Stage 1 to Stage 5.",
 "ComboStageExp09": "Great!\n\nStage 5 is important because it's the first point at which the Infinite Prevention System (IPS) can be triggered.\n\nIPS is triggered when you start a new chain of attacks in Stage 5 with an attack you've already used in your combo from Stage 3 or later. This means that IPS can't be triggered in the middle of a chain.",

These are known as \"Blockbuster Sequels.\"\n\n\nWhile hitting an opponent with a Blockbuster, you can cancel that Blockbuster into one of your teammate's by performing the motion for any of your next team member's Blockbuster attacks. Once they're on the field, you can even add another by performing the motion for the third character's Blockbuster attack.

 "High Low Mixups": "Lesson 1: High/Low Mixups\n\n\nOne way opponents may try to mix you up is by switching between high and low attacks. High attacks must be blocked while standing, but can only be delivered while jumping for the most part. Low attacks must be blocked while crouching, and are also generally delivered while crouching.\n\n\nDefending against these mix-ups is easier than it sounds. Remember, blocking low blocks both Low and Mid attacks. So when defending it's best to always block while crouching, stand only when you see the opponent jump, and crouch again as soon as your opponent lands.",
 "High/Low Offense Explanation": "High/Low Mix-ups\n\n\nWhen on the offensive, you'll have more success if you vary the height of your attacks so that it's harder for your opponent to block them all.\n\n\nThe most basic approach is to attack with a jumping attack that must be blocked High, and then a crouching attack that must be blocked Low.",
 "Hit Confirmation Explanation": "Hit Confirmation Chains\n\n\nUsing a chain of safe attacks gives you a lot of time to confirm whether your attacks hit or were blocked.

She's also a very mobile character, with fast movement, a double jump and Air Dashes a-plenty.\n\nOnce her head is removed, her {hp} attacks on her body are locked, and {hp} controls her head independently from her body. Thanks to her unique ability to be in two places at once, she can set up a variety of powerful, positional combos. Attacking her own detached head sends it flying as a projectile for extra hits as well, and a number of her attacks function differently depending on whether or not her head is attached.",

While her individual attacks aren't particularly strong, she is easy to combo with, can charge up most of her normal attacks, and can dish out some serious hurt to her opponents by reflecting their own damage against them.\n\nMost of Painwheel's normal attacks can be charged up by holding the button. Not only will this increase the attack's damage, it may also change their properties. For example, her {hp} attack will stagger her opponent when fully charged, allowing her to combo into a throw. Thanks to her unique Hatred Guard mechanic, she can absorb one to three hits without being interrupted while charging, and the damage she takes will be added to her attack.",
 "PainwheelTutorialIntro2": "Mastering Painwheel will require you to take advantage of her unique flight capabilities, extreme combo potential and learn the timing necessary to effectively wield her Hatred Guard's damage reflection capabilities.\n\nYou'll know you're doing it right when you manage to reflect ten complete lifebars' worth of damage back at your opponents in battle.",

While not particularly damaging, this attack is useful for putting distance between you and the opponent and for setting up combos. The Egret is also invincible to projectiles, but if Parasoul gets hit before he snatches the opponent, he'll pull his hand back in and slowly ride away.\n\nEgret Charge is performed by inputting {b} (hold) {f} + {hk}.

Up to three tears can be on-screen at a time, and strategic placement will allow you to trip up your opponent or add to your damage. Tears can also be ignited voluntarily by hitting them with a burning melee attack, or detonating them remotely using Napalm Trigger.\n\nNapalm Toss is performed by inputting {d} {db} {b} + (hold) {ak}.

Tears can also be ignited voluntarily by hitting them with a burning melee attack, or detonating them remotely using Napalm Trigger.\n\nNapalm Shot is performed by inputting {b} (hold) {f} + {ap}. The trajectory and speed of the napalm tears varies with the punch button you use, giving you more ways to keep your opponent guessing.",

 "ParasoulTutorialIntro": "Intro\nParasoul is a slower, more deliberate melee fighter, with long, poking attacks. She lacks double jumps and air dashes, so she isn't as mobile as some of the other fighters, but makes up for it with strong normals, zoning, and combo ability.\n\nIn addition to powerful combos, she can damage her opponent from afar and strategically pester them with projectiles that transform into temporary traps. If she's in a jam she can summon her soldiers to support her in battle, as well.",
 "ParasoulTutorialIntro2": "Parasoul's greatest strength is her ability to combo, but her other abilities offer myriad strategic options to manipulate her opponents and enhance her already strong damage capabilities.\n\nYou'll probably have gotten the hang of Parasoul's play style around the time you've summoned 100 soldiers to aid you in battle.",

 "Beowulf End 1100": "... You lost me.",
 "Beowulf End 1200": "Well, let's just say that when it comes to my show, what I want goes. It's more popular than ever, and so am I. What do you say to coming back?",
 "Beowulf End 1300": "As the Bad Wolf Man?",
 "Beowulf End 1400": "No way. You may not be cut from the same cloth as me, but you should at least get a chance \nto play a hero on TV. I think... you've earned it. ",
 "Beowulf End 1410": "You might be a schmuck, but you helped me find my way to the heart of this little problem.",
 "Beowulf End 1500": "With my strength and your green hair, we make an unbeatable team!",
 "Beowulf End 1600": "Close enough.",
 "Beowulf End 1700": "Get 'em, Beowulf!",
 "Beowulf End 1800": "This show doesn't make any sense. Who is that idiot? Didn't he used to be a bad guy?",
 "Beowulf End 1900": "Who cares, as long as there are sweet, sweet toys?",
 "Beowulf End 200": "For awhile, anyway. Sucks, but the fight never really ends... No matter how long I go on.",
 "Beowulf End 2000": "What the heck are you guys talkin' about? \n",
 "Beowulf End 300": "Man, it's really hitting me now. You are the same Annie I knew back in the day.\nThat stuff... That's real.",
 "Beowulf End 400": "You finally got it. See, that's kind of my thing. This is what I do. ",
 "Beowulf End 500": "The show? It's almost funny. The writers make up stories based on the folktales that came down through the generations -- the same ones that are based on my actual life. ",
 "Beowulf End 510": "It's kinda weird playing yourself on television, isn't it? ",
 "Beowulf End 600": "I hear that.",
 "Beowulf End 700": "You would, wouldn't you? You know, Beowulf, I misjudged you. You're kind of an idiot, \nbut not a bad guy. \n",
 "Beowulf End 710": "In fact, you remind me of somebody I used to know, years ago... Somebody who helped me \nwhen I needed it. ",
 "Beowulf End 800": "Hmm. You know, that isn't a half-bad idea.",
 "Beowulf End 900": "Right on! ",
 "Beowulf Intro 100": "The hero that did the impossible; the man that defeated a monster. He rallied a nation at war. \n",
 "Beowulf Intro 1000": "After he left the ring, he was stuck with bit parts in cheap action flicks, game shows, and even infomercials. \n",
 "Beowulf Intro 1100": "He didn't go out with a growl, but with a whimper, \nas the Bad Wolf Man on the popular kids' show Annie of the Stars.",
 "Beowulf Intro 1110": "In a few short years, the hero of a nation became comic relief, \nand soon, he was written out of the show entirely. ",
 "Beowulf Intro 1200": "Beowulf disappeared from the public eye. How long has it been since anybody's heard that famous howl?",
 "Beowulf Intro 1300": "Shaddup, TV. I still got the howl. And I got the noise complaints to prove it!",

 "Beowulf Intro 200": "There was a time when everyone could say, \"I know Beowulf.\"\n",

 "Beowulf Intro 2100": "Sister, you gotta help me! This thing is possessed!",
 "Beowulf Intro 2200": "Is that the arm of a Gigan...?",
 "Beowulf Intro 2300": "What does it look like?  Quick, do an exorcism or something!",
 "Beowulf Intro 2400": "You should rid yourself of it, child.  The dead are under the Skullgirl's control now...",
 "Beowulf Intro 2500": "Hey, I earned this trophy fair and square!  She can't have it!",
 "Beowulf Intro 2600": "Finally!  The stupid thing calmed down. ",
 "Beowulf Intro 2700": "You have been given a second chance.  Renounce it.  Be not prideful.",

 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1000": "I'm sick of surprises! Who was that guy I just fought, anyway? No camera crews in sight, and now this guy is accusing me of being a Medici thug?",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1100": "Beowulf. Buddy. Babycakes. Haven't you heard of hidden cameras? ",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1200": "Look, you pay me to do the thinking, here. You pay me to set up your fights. Then you fight. Remember? That's how the whole \"agent\" thing works. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1300": "Maybe... but this whole thing is weird, Zane, even for wrestling.",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1400": "Weird sells, baby. When you see how pumped up the crowd is for your next match... Well, it's gonna take you further than you've ever been. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1500": "You think so?",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1600": "Yeah! Remember Grendel? Forget Grendel. This match is going to leave that fossil in the dust. We are talking huge. We are talking massive. We are talking a surprise the size of New Meridian itself.",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1700": "I don't know... I ain't so sure you can pull it off.",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 1800": "Leave it in my hands. That is all I'm asking here, my little Wulf: Leave everything in my hands.",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 200": "Did you get that? The part where I said \"this is for you?\" Because they like that. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 300": "Uhh...",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 400": "I knew it! While I was wasting time with you, they got to Avian! ",

 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 600": "Sweet shark's tooth necklace you got there. That new?",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 700": "Heh. You done good, kid. You done good. I got your next match lined up. You would not believe who you're fighting. I mean you will literally not believe it. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 800": "So who is it?",
 "Beowulf Post-Bigband 900": "That would ruin the surprise! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 100": "That's what I thought.\n",

 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 1700": "And yet you still bark.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 1800": "All I needed was for you to defeat the opponents I selected.  Everything would have worked out -- for both of us. \n",

 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 2100": "You're insane!",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 2200": "I’m afraid you are mistaken, Beowulf.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 2300": "You’re the one who is...",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 2400": "IN . . .",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 2500": "ZANE!",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 300": "Regrets? I got plenty. But they're between me and Grendel.  You don't get to say a damn thing about the subject -- whoever you are. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 400": "Now get out of the ring.",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 500": "What that fraud said? It might be true. I think Grendel probably was drugged that day.",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 600": "I didn't know. I just found out. But you know what? It doesn't matter. I'll make it up to you all. I'll make it up to everybody. Even Grendel.",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 700": "Tonight, I promised you the biggest match of my career. And that? That was pathetic. So I'll make a new promise to you right now. I'm going to take on the Skullgirl!",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 800": "[Cheers]",
 "Beowulf Post-Doppel 900": "You hear me, New Meridian? I'm gonna take her down! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 100": "Yeah! I beat you!",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1000": "No more arguing. There's no way you stopped the Shapeshifter -- that must have been her domain. She'll find her way here any second. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1010": "And the Skullgirl is above us, too. We have to get everyone out of here.",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1100": "Above us...?",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1200": "Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Do NOT get any more stupid ideas. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1300": "Look, Annie... I know I screwed up. I just loved being a hero. Now everybody's saying that I never was one. If that's true, I have a duty to make it right, don't I?",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1400": "I promised all those people up there that I was going to take down the Skullgirl, right? \nI’d better do it. For them. For Grendel. Now might be our only chance.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1500": "You're not going to listen to me, are you?",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1600": "'Fraid not. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1700": "Fine. You do what you want. Go and get yourself killed. Can't say I didn't try!",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1800": "Thanks, Annie.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 1900": "Whoa, buddy... Feels like you’re itching for a fight, too! Or... is that the Skullgirl callin’ ya?",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 200": "Uh, wait. Is the rest of this place you, too? Because I can beat that, too. The Wulfman, layin' the smackdown on some seriously gross walls. And a squishy floor. Ew.",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 2000": "Up there...",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 300": "Get used to the decor. You're not leaving.",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 400": "I've still got my chair -- don't forget the chair! It's called Hurting for a reason, baby. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 500": "Perhaps you might consider using it for its intended purpose and sit, boy.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 600": "I could make you much less comfortable. My patience for you won't last.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 700": "Dam-- Dang it, Beowulf!",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 800": "What did I tell you? And did you listen? Nope, not Beowulf. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Double 900": "Now, look --",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 100": "That little demonstration should put any doubts about my comeback to rest! \n",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1000": "I! Am! So! Pumped! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1100": "Good, good. This is just the beginning -- Zane MacDougal is gonna take you all the way this time. \nI promise.",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1200": "Before too long, you'll be taking on the whole world's enemy -- the Skullgirl -- in front of the cameras!",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1300": "This train don't stop!",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1400": "Not this time!",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1500": "But first things first. The town's in an uproar, right? Because of the Skullgirl. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1510": "The populace is, how can I put this -- they're hugging their teddy bears and crying. You can hear 'em out there, crying in fear. And do you know why?",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1600": "I don't! Tell me why!",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1700": "I'll tell you why. It's because there are so many freaks on the streets. The Skullgirl shows up, everything goes all wobbly, and the characters come popping out of the woodwork. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1800": "We need someone to put them back in the woodwork. Do you think you could be a carpenter for me, Beowulf? \n",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 1900": "Don't you worry, man! My entire body's a hammer!\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 200": "That's just what I'll do to the Skullgirl, too!",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2000": "Uh... right.  Right.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2100": "Look, it's all set up. You don't have to worry about a thing. The cameras will capture your brave battle on behalf of the little people. Can you do that for me? ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2200": "I can be a hero! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2300": "You wanna be a hero? Go and get 'em! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2400": "I love the way you think, man -- always one step ahead!",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2500": "Who are you?  You can't stop me!",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2600": "That's right! The Wulf is here to put a stop to -- ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2700": "Wait, wait a second.  Hey, you guy!  Roll camera!  This is going to be epic. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2800": "What's he talking about?",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 2900": "No idea.",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 300": "[Cheers] ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 3000": "You think you can make a fool out of me? GET OUT OF MY WAY!",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 400": "Oof...",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 500": "...You okay?",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 600": "Don't worry about me, big guy.  It's usually worse than this.",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 700": "How'd ya like your first headliner?  You taste blood out there, babe?  You smell the crowd?",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 710": "They're hungry for more!  They're dying for the Wulf! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 800": "Forget that no-name you just dropped on the mat. Even Grendel is ancient history. You're back! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Intro 900": "It's like the last few years never even happened. I'm so glad we're back in business together, bro! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 100": "You... were stronger than I anticipated. Almost strong enough... But much of your strength is borrowed. I... can take that advantage away from you. And I will turn it against you. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1000": "Just like old times. You get used and abused, and I stumble my way into the hero role.",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1100": "Grendel...",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1200": "Forget the past. Let us settle this, as WARRIORS!",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1300": "?!",

 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1400": "The Skull Heart! Beowulf, smash it!\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1500": "This one’s...\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1600": "...for GRENDELLLL!",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1700": "It’s over, monster!",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 1800": "I'll see you again, child...",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 200": "Damn! Things can’t get worse than this!",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 300": "Foolish Beowulf. Become food for the dragon!",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 400": "Tag Team? Harsh! I guess I set that one up...",
 "Beowulf Post-Marie 500": "GALAXY...",

 "Beowulf Post-PW 100": "I WON'T GO BACK! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME! ",
 "Beowulf Post-PW 200": "She's gone. Man, Zane wasn't kidding about the freak show.",
 "Beowulf Post-PW 300": "That fight was one big highlight reel! Remember, the tape goes to Zane MacDougal. Write it down, would ya, buddy?",
 "Beowulf Post-PW 400": "We... only deliver what's on our menu.",
 "Beowulf Post-PW 500": "Don't you worry, babe. It's all part of the Beowulf comeback story. A big, beautiful story. Good ol' Zane's gonna make you look your best!",
 "Beowulf Post-PW 600": "Zane -- what are you doing here?",
 "Beowulf Post-PW 700": "Oh, don't sweat it.  I saw everything. You did good here today, kid, real good!  Come to my office tomorrow -- we'll talk about your next match.",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 100": "I must have more strength than you bargained on.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1000": "Do you have any clue what's really going on around here?",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1100": "You want something, kid?",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1200": "Maybe you're dumber than I thought. Annie, Girl of the Stars? Remember?",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1300": "Whoa, crazy! Man, you look just like the Annie I used to work with. I can tell the difference, though! It's... the hair! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1400": "...",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1500": "Look, Beowulf. You're messing with things you don't understand. This isn't a show. It isn't a wrestling match. It's real, and you'll die. Stay away from the Skullgirl.",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1600": "Hey!  Wrestling is real!",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1700": "If my hunch is right, whoever's behind your latest stunt is way worse than a crooked agent. You were already set up once. Don’t be fooled again.",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1800": "What are you talking about?\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 1900": "The Gigan.  You're telling me you didn't notice? ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 200": "I didn't expect this... You can actually wield that Gigan's arm like a weapon. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 2000": "Oh no, not you too!  Kids these days!",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 2100": "Beowulf, it's time to grow up.  Open your eyes!  Stop fooling yourself, and stop fighting for somebody you can't trust. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 2200": "And I can trust you? ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 2300": "See you later, \"Annie\" -- if that's even your name!",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 300": "I've picked up a few tricks since I beat him.\n",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 400": "You beat a Gigan? Don't make me laugh. I lived that war, little man. You posed for the crowds, \nbut you never once visited the battlefield.  ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 500": "Alone against a Gigan warrior at full strength?  You'd never stand a chance.",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 600": "Then again, your ignorance may be staggering, but that has its uses, too. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 700": "Who are you calling ignorant?  You just got schooled by the Wulf! ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 800": "And it was a lesson about not wasting my time. Sadly, I can see that you haven't learned \nanything at all. ",
 "Beowulf Post-Valentine 900": "I must be going, Beowulf.  Good luck with your career.\n",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 100": "You aren't kidding about the weirdos, Zane.  Wish I could wrestle some of the guys from \nback in the day. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1000": "Which is good, because I have another little problem -- I mean, another opportunity lined up. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1010": "I need you at the River King Casino, PDQ. I set up a match with a freak called \"Big Band.\" \nYou can't miss him -- big as a house, with a trench coat draped over the mess. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1100": "There he is! ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1200": "Hey, you! You ready to go?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1300": "Are you talking to me?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1400": "Damn right I am! The Wulf is about to howl!",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1500": "What does that even mean?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1600": "It means it's time for you to prepare yourself for a legendary beatdown!",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1700": "Why is a washed-up TV wrestler getting in my way?  You hit hard times, and now you're Medici muscle? ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1800": "Hey! Who are you calling washed-up?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 1900": "But that reminds me... Yo, camera girl!  Make sure you capture that sweet, sweet moment when I slam him right into the ground! ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 200": "It's the Skullgirl's influence -- it brings them out!\n",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 2000": "Uh... I'm just here for the catering.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 300": "Out of the woodwork, right. You said that.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 400": "I thought you wanted to be New Meridian's number one!  ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 500": "Times change, my friend. You've got to keep up. Forget the old days. You're complaining to me -- while your fans are howling for the Wulf!",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 600": "But the stuff I've been hearing --",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 700": "Nonsense. Forget it! You know how people get. They just want to tear you down. They know you're on to something.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 800": "Think about your career. Your Wulfpack is back. Who cares about the rest? ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Bigband 900": "You know, you're right. The Wulf is back! ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 100": "Are you ready, Wulfpack? Are you ready to howl? \n",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 1000": "If you say so.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 1100": "Strange, isn't it, that an elderly woman would be harder to best than a warrior in his prime?\n",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 1200": "The only way to rile up the people was to show that the Gigans could be beaten. It was a setup. \nThe one time the Medicis worked with the government... It came off perfectly. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 1300": "No!",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 1400": "You know it's true, Beowulf. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 1500": "It's time to hang up your chair. Apologize to the crowd, and leave the ring.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 1600": "That ain't gonna happen. This is my house. Right or wrong, nobody leaves this ring without a fight!",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 200": "[Cheers]",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 300": "I've fought hard to make it back here. And tonight? We've got a surprise for you! I agreed to a mystery match -- for you! I'm doing it for all you out there in New Meridian!",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 400": "[Cheers]",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 500": "Playing to the crowd, just like always.  And they're eating it up.  How nice for you, Beowulf.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 600": "Who are you supposed to be?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 700": "I'd ask you the same question. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 800": "By now, you can't pretend you don't know that the fight was rigged. That Grendel was drugged. That you're no hero.\n",
 "Beowulf Pre-Doppel 900": "Think back to that day, Beowulf.  Grendel's elderly mother, sobbing over her dead son, put up more of a fight than he did. Didn't she?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Double 100": "I beat some of these guys, and now they're down here? Who the heck are you?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Double 200": "Poor, lost soul. Don't you recognize me?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Double 300": "These inferior beings dared get in our way, and that sealed their fate. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Double 400": "This is the road you have chosen, and so you shall join them. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Double 500": "You should have listened to me. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Double 600": "Alas, I see now that you never would. It is the folly of men to be strong-headed fools.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Double 700": "And now it's too late for you!",
 "Beowulf Pre-Marie 100": "Ironic. You plan to fight me... with that. A corpse's arm.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Marie 200": "I thought you and the dead were best buds. Seems appropriate.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Marie 300": "You comprehend nothing. I have only sympathy for Grendel. You exploited him during the war -- \nand even now, you still do.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Marie 400": "You're right. I know the truth now. It wasn't a fair fight.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Marie 500": "But Grendel... He's my partner now. Has been for years. That's why I'm going to make things right -- \nby taking you down.  Maybe after that, the big guy can rest in peace.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Marie 600": " Is that supposed to make you feel better about what you did?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Marie 700": "A hollow sentiment. In truth, you fight for glory. But you have picked the wrong fight, this time. \nYou will find only the grave.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Valentine 100": "Who's there?! \n",
 "Beowulf Pre-Valentine 200": "Oh, how amusing. I was looking for my wayward project and I find, instead, a famous fool. \nYou must be the one who beat her. \n",
 "Beowulf Pre-Valentine 300": "I beat somebody... or something. Screamed a lot. That who you mean?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Valentine 400": "She clearly isn't ready if she lost to you. ",
 "Beowulf Pre-Valentine 500": "But it's survival of the fittest. This city is a proving ground, after all.",
 "Beowulf Pre-Valentine 600": "I just want to clean up New Meridian...  The Skullgirl's out there, somewhere, and I'm gonna find her!\n",
 "Beowulf Pre-Valentine 700": "You plan to fight the Skullgirl?",
 "Beowulf Pre-Valentine 800": "I've decided that it's your turn.  Let's test YOU out.\n",
 "BigBand End 100": "Not bad, Big Ben! You did good, I guess. Not like these cuckoos.",
 "BigBand End 1000": "New Meridian. It's not what it used to be -- but neither am I.",
 "BigBand End 1100": "Yo, Band Camp! You ever think about publishing your stories? We could call 'em Defective Comics!",
 "BigBand End 1200": "Naw. I don't want to steal the spotlight from you. We wouldn't even have to change the title.",
 "BigBand End 1300": "Haha...  Hey, wait a minute!",
 "BigBand End 200": "Hey!",
 "BigBand End 300": "You'll have your day. You just have to live long enough to see it.",
 "BigBand End 400": "Getting beat by the Skullgirl was just a reality check. The next one is gonna hurt even worse. \nIt might even kill you.",
 "BigBand End 410": "If you want to survive it, you'd better learn your lesson and learn it good.",
 "BigBand End 500": "I ain't a big fan of reality, Pops. And lessons put me to sleep. Give me cartoons any day!",
 "BigBand End 600": "Sometimes you gotta be taught your limitations the hard way.\nThe good news is that you don't have to face reality alone.",
 "BigBand End 700": "Truth is, you never stop learning. I got a refresher today, too. Painwheel and Peacock -- and others like them -- need somebody to keep 'em on track. Might as well be me, right?",
 "BigBand End 800": "I'm not dumb enough to think this is a happy ending. Ain't no such thing.",
 "BigBand End 810": "The nun, the nurse, and the Skullgirl ain't the only shadows falling on New Meridian.\nWe're gonna need those girls if we don't want to lose the last of the light.",
 "BigBand End 900": "Seeing the Skullgirl trash my city and kill my comrades... Taking her down wasn't for revenge.\nBut it felt good just the same. This city and me, we've been through a lot.",
 "BigBand Intro 100": "New Meridian's a dangerous city. Even for me.",
 "BigBand Intro 1000": "These days, I walk a different beat.",
 "BigBand Intro 1100": "The Skullgirls. They play by a whole different set of rules, and they'll keep on coming \nuntil we put an end to the source of their power -- the Skull Heart.",
 "BigBand Intro 1200": "That's my job.",
 "BigBand Intro 1300": "If I can do that, we don't have to worry -- for a while.",
 "BigBand Intro 1400": "To find the Skull Heart, I gotta track the Skullgirl. To track the Skullgirl, I gotta go where she'll be.",
 "BigBand Intro 1500": "Turns out this one has it in for the Medicis. This should be fun.",
 "BigBand Intro 200": "Especially for me.",
 "BigBand Intro 300": "I used to be a cop... and I always tried to do the right thing.\nBut I got one thing wrong, and it just about cost me my life.",
 "BigBand Intro 400": "You see, I thought the police were supposed to catch the bad guys.",
 "BigBand Intro 500": "It doesn't work like that in New Meridian.",
 "BigBand Intro 600": "My squad was on the take from the Medici Mafia.",
 "BigBand Intro 700": "You can guess what happened next.",
 "BigBand Intro 800": "They left me for dead. They thought I was gone.",
 "BigBand Intro 900": "Turns out that I'm full of surprises.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 100": "Time to check out the River King Casino. A Medici joint lit up like a Christmas tree with Theonite readings -- if it's not the Skullgirl, I don't know what it is.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1000": "I'm not stupid, buddy! I don't know what you think you're up to, but I know guys like you. And if a guy like you doesn't work for us, well, he needs a damn good reason to be here. Get it?",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1100": "Girl, you don't want what you're asking for.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1200": "Geez! One-man band? More like one-man army!",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1300": "There was a time when I cared about wasting the Medicis, but y'all have moved down a few notches in my priorities.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1400": "Nowadays, I'm more worried about wasting my time.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1500": "Big Band! Come in! Lab 8 is under attack! You've got to hurry! We can't -- *BZZT*",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1600": "Since the Skullgirl didn't stick around... It looks like this was a setup.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1700": "Sorry, missie, but I've got somewhere else I've gotta be. You watch your step from now on.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1800": "Showed up sooner than I expected, you old copycat.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 1900": "Who are you supposed to be? There's only one Big Band. You ain't fooling nobody.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 200": "Hey, you! Big guy in the coat! Hold it!",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2000": "Your very existence is a symbol of humanity's arrogance. The parts of you that can still be considered alive are on borrowed time -- and that time is over.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2100": "Even cloaked in your form, my superiority will be clear!",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2200": "If you think you're scaring me, then you really don't know a damn thing about me. \nLet me teach you something.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2300": "I might be made of metal, but you're the one with the tin ear. You might try to copy my style, \nbut you can't fake soul.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2400": "The next time we fight, my power will not be so limited.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2500": "Somebody got in here and trashed the place.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2600": "And while they were doing it, somebody else kept me out.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2700": "...",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2800": "Figures. It wasn't me they wanted. It was the Doc.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 2900": "Damn. My night just got a whole hell of a lot worse.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 300": "I can tell you're a pro, and I don't mean at gambling. What're you doing here?",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 3000": "Course, soon enough, theirs will too... when I catch up with them.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 3100": "They trashed this place good. They knew what to hit, and they knew how hard.\nThey've been in a lab like this one before.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 3200": "And these scalpels? They ain't the Doc's, and they sure as hell ain't what you'd find \ndown at New Meridian General, either. That gives me some ideas.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 3300": "Time to find the Lab 8 survivors before somebody else does.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 400": "Thought I'd try my luck, maybe catch a show.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 500": "Well, too bad. The show caught you!",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 600": "I have a feeling there ain't just poker chips in those pockets. Open your coat!",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 700": "That won't be necessary. I've seen what I need to see. Turns out this just ain't my scene.",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 800": "Why don't you get back to entertaining your adoring patrons with your acrobatics?",
 "BigBand Post-Intro 900": "I'll see myself to the door.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 100": "What is it about tonight? I can't swing a dead ME without hitting an alley full of weirdos.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1000": "She's helping me with a case, Ben. I need all the help I can get. Things are crazy these days -- though you don't need me to tell you that.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1100": "You can say that again. The Skullgirl got some help that knows a bit too much about the ASG operation. The Lab got tossed and Avian's dead.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1200": "*whistles* Actually, I was looking for you. Things are going to hell around here, but I'll spare you the song and dance. It sounds like you've got much bigger problems, my friend.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1300": "I'm looking for somebody who uses heavy-duty scalpels. Someone who knows their way around a lab, too. And if it's who I think it is... There ain't an aspirin big enough to dent my headaches tonight.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1400": "Say no more. Get on with your search, big man. If you want my advice, head downtown -- there's some shady goings-on that smell like Skullgirl.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1500": "And don't worry about me, all right? I'm no rookie. I can handle one dismembered small-timer.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1600": "Just don't let her out of your sight.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1700": "And if you get him killed, lady, I'll be back to separate your head from your shoulders... permanently.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1800": "Oh, officer! I'm as innocent as a kitten.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 1900": "Do I look stupid?",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 200": "And lookee here! A Medici tinman, out for a stroll -- right next to a body of water conveniently placed for dumping his sorry corpse, too.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2000": "Well...",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 210": "Good thing this one looks like he'll sink. It's time to get some revenge for the Fishbone Gang!",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2100": "Can it.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2200": "What in the hell was that!?",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2300": "The Skullgirl has revealed herself -- and her attention is fixed elsewhere. She may have destroyed Lab 8, but she now has found a more fitting target for her wrath. Join me.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2400": "I want to see New Meridian cleaned up, but not like this... Damn!",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2500": "This is the perfect opportunity. While her attention is fixed on keeping that tower aloft, she is vulnerable. We must strike immediately, and decisively.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2510": "You will engage the Skullgirl with Painwheel. The Skullgirl will not be able to retaliate -- and should be no match for a coordinated assault from two ASG units.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2600": "No dice. Do you know how many people will die if we do it your way, and she drops the tower? \nWe've got her in our sights now.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2610": "It's only a matter of time before we take her down. We can do it without the collateral damage.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2700": "That is of no consequence. The only thing that matters is destroying her before her power further awakens.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2800": "You know, if I couldn't see your big damn brain, I'd be asking myself if you even had one.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 2900": "This is your response after you cost us Avian?",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 300": "You're messing with the wrong man, lady.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3000": "The only miscalculation I've made is in attempting to work with another soft-hearted \nfool from Lab 8.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3010": "Avian, at least, served the cause by creating weapons to battle the Skullgirls -- even if those weapons have obvious flaws.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3100": "Mine are not so weak. Painwheel, it falls to you. Go now -- attack the Skullgirl.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3200": "Nope. I don't think so.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3300": "If we must go through you, then that is what we will do. Painwheel, destroy this defective tool, \nand do it quickly. You must pursue the Skullgirl before we lose our chance.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3400": "Stop... ordering me...",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3500": "Do it. NOW.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3600": "RRRGH!",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3700": "You should have defeated a relic such as this one easily. I saw to that. But I can sense your resistance, Painwheel.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3710": "I had thought you would be the perfect vessel -- but, sadly, you yet require refinement.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3800": "You've wasted my efforts. Return to Lab 0 immediately for reprogramming.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 3900": "NO!",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 400": "We'll see about that.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4000": "I will expect you shortly. Obey my command or suffer the consequences. I will tolerate no further disappointment.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4100": "You don't have to listen to him, girl.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4200": "Who... are you?",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4300": "I'm just another Anti-Skullgirl soldier. The difference is nobody tells me what to do. \nAnd if you let us help you, it could be the same for you.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4400": "While that knucklehead was runnin' his mouth, I called a friend, Leduc. \nHe'll be here soon, and he'll take you somewhere safe.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4500": "They've done some terrible things to her... You want me to take her back to Lab 8's crew?",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4600": "Yep. Ileum will know what to do.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4700": "What are you going to do?",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 4800": "Me? I've got to track down the other one before she gets herself killed. And now I know where she'll be.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 500": "Fortune, hold it! This is my old partner!",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 600": "Nyao he tells me!",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 700": "If you wouldn't run off on your own...",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 800": "Sorry, Ben. She's with me. Little flakey, but she gets the job done... in the end. \nShe's helping me do some recon.",
 "BigBand Post-Middle 900": "You used to cuff 'em, not cuddle 'em.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 100": "I sure hope Peacock isn't dead. I'd whup you either way, but I'll enjoy it more if I'm not \ndistracted by rage.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1000": "You both want the Medicis to pay. Why, then, must you fight me?",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1100": "The Medicis are run-of-the-mill street trash. But you... There's no bigger threat than a Skullgirl on the loose.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1200": "Nothing personal, but these days, I have just one job: to stop your heart from beating.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1300": "Turns out we got hired by the same employer.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1400": "They ain't too picky, but what can you do? Business is booming! Why, you ask?",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1500": "It's Skullgirl season!",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1600": "Once, at the orphanage, you tried to save me -- but I won't hold back this time!",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1700": "That's why I gotta do this, Marie. You're losing control.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1800": "Then come, if you dare.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 1900": "And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for my greatest hit!",
 "BigBand Pre-End 200": "You mean Patricia... No, I did not kill her. I could not. But for the sake of destroying the ones who abused us, I was forced to deal with her.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 2000": "Every time you destroy this vessel, another will appear. \nThere is no purpose to your actions. I shall always return.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 2100": "So what?",
 "BigBand Pre-End 300": "And now you have to deal with me.",
 "BigBand Pre-End 400": "Don'tcha mean \"us,\" Big Blag?",
 "BigBand Pre-End 500": "Peacock?",
 "BigBand Pre-End 600": "The one and only!",
 "BigBand Pre-End 700": "Patricia? You intend to battle me again?",
 "BigBand Pre-End 800": "That first go-round was just a warmup, old pal!",
 "BigBand Pre-End 900": "Now that I've got my backup band, it's time to jam!",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 100": "Another Lab 8 loser! Makes three-for-one today. First, that fool Avian...",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 1000": "Mementos? How sweet -- since it looks like you turned traitor in exchange for your life. \nThat's when you hooked up with your churchy friend, right?",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 1100": "I saw an opportunity and I took it.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 1200": "We all run out of luck one day -- like you did all those years ago. Like you did just now.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 1300": "And you will never trouble another soul.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 200": "So Peacock IS here. Thanks.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 300": "More like \"was.\" You're a bit late, I'm afraid. Marie has made short work of her -- as Double and I will of you.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 400": "I see how it is. You knocked off the Doc while your shifty pal \"Double\" -- nice name there, \nreal clever -- kept me busy.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 500": "And now I will defeat you on my terms... not yours.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 600": "A nurse and a nun. You ever read your own job descriptions? I'll buy you a paper so you can check the classifieds. It's cheap, and you might learn something.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 700": "The only one who's going to learn a lesson is you! You'll feel a little sting -- and then you won't feel anything at all.",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 800": "Think so? I'm not so sure. You don't seem like much without your squad. The Last Hope has a lot to answer for. Where are they?",
 "BigBand Pre-Midboss 900": "Gone, though I keep their mementos with me. I can schedule an appointment if you want to meet them -- in fact, I have an opening right now!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 100": "That Skullgirl's got my blood on the boil. C'mon boys, we're off!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1000": "Scram! Beat it! Get outta here, you big mook!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1100": "Take it easy, Peacock. Stop and think.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1200": "Thinkin' ain't my game, Brassafrass! My job is clobberin' Skullgirls!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1300": "Howsabout you take care of the kiddies while I exit stage left?",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1400": "Big talk -- but you ain't ready to walk that talk.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1500": "We'll track her down and take her out together.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1600": "Ol' Saxy ain't gonna let you go! Clean his clock!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1700": "Don't clown me, Peacock. I do not fool around.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1800": "Too bad, Big Bird! All I do is fool around!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 1900": "You pack a wallop for an old guy -- but you can't stop this toon!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 200": "It's murder time!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2000": "Oh, Tommy~!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 210": "We're returning to Lab 8 to pick up the pieces, Peacock. That's our priority.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2100": "'Scuse me!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2200": "Damn! She's gone.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2300": "That fool is going to get herself killed. If she can't even take me out, no way she's ready to face off against a Skullgirl. And if I can't stop her, Dr. Avian's work goes down the drain.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2310": "Ain't no way I'm gonna allow that -- especially not now. Sorry, but I've gotta go after her.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2400": "Don't worry about us. You take care of Peacock. We'll head back to the lab.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2500": "The Doc... didn't make it out. So now I've gotta track down Peacock, the Skullgirl, and his killer.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2600": "I'd say I was earning my pension tonight, but somehow I don't think Lab 8 offers a retirement plan.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 2700": "I like to think we offer other benefits.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 300": "I'm with Ileum. This fight isn't over, and we need to get our hands on whatever might help.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 3000": "Ain't that right? Later, Whitefin.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 3100": "Be careful, Ben. Come back to us in one piece.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 400": "Who cares!?",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 500": "They might come back, Peacock. We've got to get there first!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 600": "Did you trade your brain for a beehive?",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 700": "I get the Skullgirl. I smash the Skull Heart. Ker-pow! After that, Easy Street!",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 800": "Not so fast.",
 "BigBand Pre-Middle 900": "Aw, man! Not the blowhard!",
 "Cerebella Ending A 100": "Forget the wish. I need to find that thief and bring her back to Vitale.",
 "Cerebella Ending A 1000": "...And it's all thanks to you, Cerebella.",
 "Cerebella Ending A 101": "Thanks for dealing with Marie for me, circus-girl!",
 "Cerebella Ending A 200": "...Let me go! I've got to avenge my friends... no, my family!\nWith one wish, I can end the Medici Mafia!",
 "Cerebella Ending A 300": "I can't let you make that wish -- that's my family you're talking about now!",
 "Cerebella Ending A 400": "With or without my wish, I'll destroy them!",
 "Cerebella Ending A 500": "As long as the Life Gem's power flows through my veins, \nno one can stop me from avenging the Fishbone Gang!",
 "Cerebella Ending A 600": "...Flows through your veins, huh?",
 "Cerebella Ending A 700": "Well done -- you've exceeded my greatest expectations!",
 "Cerebella Ending A 800": "That mangy cat-burglar won't be bothering us any more. The Skullgirl has been defeated, \nand the Life Gem is back in Medici hands.",
 "Cerebella Ending A 900": "Our empire will be truly everlasting -- soon, even the royal Renoir family will be no match for the Medicis!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 01": "...Can it really make him love me?",
 "Cerebella Ending B 02": "I guess there's only one way to find out.",
 "Cerebella Ending B 03": "Skull Heart, I wish for Vitale to love me and only me... forever!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 04": "...Foolish girl.",
 "Cerebella Ending B 05": "Return to him to see what you have wrought.",
 "Cerebella Ending B 06": "Vitale!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 07": "I'm back!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 08": "...CEREBELLA!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 09": "What... what are you doing, Vitale!?",
 "Cerebella Ending B 10": "...ONLY YOU.",
 "Cerebella Ending B 11": "ONLY YOU, CEREBELLA.",
 "Cerebella Ending B 12": "He... murdered them all!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 13": "He's gone mad!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 14": "Oh no, I...",
 "Cerebella Ending B 15": "I'm sorry Cerebella -- I know how you feel about him. I didn't mean to!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 16": "He just attacked, and...",
 "Cerebella Ending B 17": "...CE-RE-BEL-LA.",
 "Cerebella Ending B 18": "FOREVER... WITH... YOU...",
 "Cerebella Ending B 19": "Oh no... Did I do this!?",
 "Cerebella Ending B 20": "He survived... He's become some kind of monster!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 22": "We've got to run!",
 "Cerebella Ending B 23": "What the hell happened to Vitale?",
 "Cerebella Ending B 24": "We definitely can't go back to the circus after this... so I guess it's just you and me now, eh, Cerebella?",
 "Cerebella Ending B 25": "We'll start a new life together... someplace small in the countryside. What do you say, Cerebella?",
 "Cerebella Ending B 26": "...Cerebella?",
 "Cerebella Ending Choice 100": "So, this is it: the Skull Heart, the source of the Skullgirl's power.",
 "Cerebella Ending Choice A": "“I need to finish my mission...”",
 "Cerebella Ending Choice B": "“Can it really...?”",
 "Cerebella Intro 100": "Ladies and Gentlemen!",
 "Cerebella Intro 1000": "The tightrope, though? I think we'd sell a lot more balcony tickets if you kept your act in the center ring.",
 "Cerebella Intro 1100": "Aw, thanks Feng!\nBut think about it -- if I were down below, no one would ever look up to see you!",
 "Cerebella Intro 1200": "Hmm, now where is he...",
 "Cerebella Intro 1300": "...There he is!",
 "Cerebella Intro 1400": "...Cerebella.",
 "Cerebella Intro 1500": "Did you see me, Vitale?",
 "Cerebella Intro 1600": "When Feng told me you were coming, I practiced all weekend. I even added the elephants!\nAnd they didn't poop on her this time!",
 "Cerebella Intro 1700": "...Did you really need to bring that up, Cerebella?",
 "Cerebella Intro 1800": "Yes, yes... it was fine. That hat of yours can put on quite a show.",
 "Cerebella Intro 1900": "Now, to business -- can I speak to you in private? I have a job that requires your... special talents.",
 "Cerebella Intro 200": "The moment you've all been waiting for!",
 "Cerebella Intro 2000": "Oh... sure. Is that why you came?",
 "Cerebella Intro 2100": "I need you to... deal with someone for me, Cerebella.",
 "Cerebella Intro 2200": "What do you mean? Do you want me to catch them?",
 "Cerebella Intro 2300": "Think of it as... bringing them to justice, my dear -- a crime against the family cannot go unpunished.",
 "Cerebella Intro 2400": "The perpetrator is Nadia Fortune, the infamous cat burglar -- and a Feral.",
 "Cerebella Intro 2500": "She has stolen something from us, a jewel called the “Life Gem.” Its value cannot be understated.",
 "Cerebella Intro 2600": "A thief? No one messes with the Medicis!",
 "Cerebella Intro 2700": "We thought she had been... taken care of, yet somehow she remains a thorn in our side.",
 "Cerebella Intro 2800": "You are to pursue her and reclaim the Life Gem from her at ANY cost.",
 "Cerebella Intro 2900": "...Am I understood?",
 "Cerebella Intro 300": "Our star attraction, the ultimate combination of power and beauty...!",
 "Cerebella Intro 3000": "Any cost -- got it!\nConsider it done, Vitale!",
 "Cerebella Intro 3100": "There's a good girl.",
 "Cerebella Intro 3200": "Some of Dahlia's men claim to have seen her in that horrid fish-town, Little Innsmouth. I recommend you start your search there.",
 "Cerebella Intro 400": "And master of the Living Weapon, Vice Versa...!",
 "Cerebella Intro 500": "The star with the... er, FROM THE big top...\nCEREBELLA!",
 "Cerebella Intro 600": "Woohoo! We love you, Cerebella!",
 "Cerebella Intro 700": "Look this way, Cerebella! Take a bow!",
 "Cerebella Intro 800": "Yes! I can't wait for the encore!",
 "Cerebella Intro 900": "Great job out there, Cerebella!",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 100": "You and that hat make a good team -- I'll give him one thing, Vitale sure knows how to pick his women.",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 1000": "...WAIT!",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 1100": "Damn, she got away.\nSo she doesn't have the gem... but I can't let Vitale down!",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 1200": "It looks like she's headed towards the Grand Cathedral. I'll capture her and take her back to Vitale! He'll think of something!",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 200": "Look, you seem nice... Naive, but nice.",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 300": "I'll give it to you straight -- I wasn't lying when I said I can't return the Life Gem.",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 400": "...Do you seriously expect me to take the word of a thief!?",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 500": "Why do you think my body is this way? It's because I swallowed that weird gem the Fishbone Gang stole from Lorenzo.",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 600": "That's when that Dahlia broad and her goons caught us.",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 700": "Next thing I know, I wake up on the ocean floor, chopped up and in a pile with the rest of my gang... only I'm still alive.",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 800": "Anyway, I'm off to steal me a Skull Heart -- say “Hi” to your boss for me... and tell him that I'll be paying a visit real soon.",
 "Cerebella Post-Middle 900": "Ciao!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 100": "That'll show you -- nobody gets between me and my job!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 1000": "To eradicate them, I must eliminate you.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 1100": "I... am sorry.\nDie.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 200": "...Dammit, that thief snuck off while we were fighting!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 300": "Your quarry has entered the catacombs.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 301": "To complete her vengeance against the Medicis, she will confront the Skullgirl and claim \nthe Skull Heart for herself.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 400": "The Skull Heart can give you anything you desire... even the love of another.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 401": "Hurry and you can take her place.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 500": "I know you're down here, Nadia Fortune!\nYou can't run any longer!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 600": "The Feral you seek is not here.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 700": "So you're the Skullgirl... You've hurt a lot of my friends, you know.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 800": "Strange -- you are pure, at least compared to the company that keeps you.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Endboss 900": "...But your masters, the Medicis, must never be allowed to claim the Skull Heart.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Midboss 100": "...Despite being mutilated so, the Feral's body still lives. Simply amazing.\nI must perform more tests.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Midboss 200": "Hands off that cat!\nThe Medicis have a score to settle with her.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Midboss 300": "...Did you hear that, kitty?\nThe Medicis' lapdog has come to save you!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Midboss 400": "Sorry, but there's no way I'm giving away my new toy -- we have lots of playtime ahead in the lab.",
 "Cerebella Pre-Midboss 500": "Double! We have work to do!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Middle 100": "That meal was the cat's pajamas! I'll literally burst if I'm not careful!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Middle 200": "See you next week, Mew Nyan!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Middle 300": "A-ha! At last I've found you, Nadia Fortune!\nReturn the Life Gem, or things are going to get rough!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Middle 400": "What's this nya-o? Circus get-up, attitude to spare, low-cut dress...",
 "Cerebella Pre-Middle 500": "Let me guess, you're one of Vitale's goons?",
 "Cerebella Pre-Middle 600": "That's right, you mangy thief! Now return the Life Gem!",
 "Cerebella Pre-Middle 700": "Quit clowning around -- you didn't actually think it'd be that easy, did you?",
 "Cerebella Pre-Middle 800": "I'm afraid I can't give you the gem... but I can give you a walloping instead!",
 "Double Ending 100": "...Her spirit was too strong -- the Skull Heart couldn't properly penetrate it, \nso synchronization was incomplete.",
 "Double Ending 200": "...Yes, I have chosen a new host. The other candidates will be consumed.",
 "Double Epilogue 100": "I think... I'm getting the hang of this game.",
 "Double Epilogue 1000": "However, there is one timeline where all the threads converge... Including our own.",
 "Double Epilogue 1100": "Now THAT sounds like fun -- I can't wait to get out of here!",
 "Double Epilogue 200": "This is a “joystick” -- a device that fell in from the 21st century. \nI find it helps me trace the branching threads of fate on the other side.",
 "Double Epilogue 300": "A “joystick?” With a name like that, you'd think it'd be a bit more... exciting..",
 "Double Epilogue 400": "Maybe you're doing it wrong -- what if I...?",
 "Double Epilogue 500": "Calm down, sister -- you'll have your fun in due time.",
 "Double Epilogue 600": "Girls! Dinner's ready!",
 "Double Epilogue 700": "Stop playing and come eat before it gets cold!",
 "Double Epilogue 800": "One second, Mother -- I just need to save my game!",
 "Double Epilogue 900": "Before we go, I'll tell you this -- each branch is a history that might have been.",
 "Double Intro 100": "You needn't run any more, child. The Trinity has heard your cries.",
 "Double Intro 200": "...Yes.",
 "Double Intro 300": "...I will begin collecting candidates immediately.",
 "Double Pre-Endboss 100": "...Indeed, Harvesting is behind schedule. This will be remedied.",
 "Double Pre-Endboss 200": "...Yes, I have captured seven candidates -- Marie will be eliminated and replaced.",
 "Double Pre-Endboss 300": "...Our masters are displeased.",
 "Double Pre-Endboss 400": "...Yes.",
 "Double Pre-Endboss 500": "I have nearly cut the Medici cancer from the heart of this city -- once that is complete, I will do their bidding.",
 "Double Pre-Endboss 600": "They are tired of waiting.",
 "Double Pre-Endboss 700": "You exist for a single purpose. As you deny your purpose, they deny your continued existence.",
 "Double Pre-Endboss 800": "...I will not let you stop me!",
 "Double Pre-Middle 100": "Double, you are to attack Anti-Skullgirl Lab 8 and destroy as much of their research as possible.",
 "Double Pre-Middle 200": "However, you must leave Peacock alone.",
 "Double Pre-Middle 300": "I cannot comply -- Peacock is perhaps the most serious threat to our mission here.",
 "Double Pre-Middle 400": "To let her live would be folly.",
 "Double Pre-Middle 500": "I command you to leave her alone -- I made a promise.",
 "Double Pre-Middle 600": "Irrelevant -- your promises mean nothing to our masters. We exist to serve them.",
 "Double Pre-Middle 700": "...Our plan is proceeding apace.",
 "Double Pre-Middle 800": "...Yes, somehow she wields your power to further her own agenda.",
 "Double Pre-Middle 900": "...Understood -- I will continue.",
 "Eliza End 100": "Shall I prepare the car?",
 "Eliza End 1000": "!!!",
 "Eliza End 1100": "Were you not told? This is not over. ",
 "Eliza End 200": "No. I'll be going out on my own tonight.",
 "Eliza End 300": "Civilization has made so many advances, but some problems are eternal.  A strong leader is always required. ",
 "Eliza End 400": "I will remind them who stands at its apex.",
 "Eliza End 500": "I'm going to put on a show for the whole world --",
 "Eliza End 600": "and as usual, the Medici will supply me the stage.",
 "Eliza End 700": "Let them all...",
 "Eliza End 800": "...bathe in my glory.",
 "Eliza End 900": "",
 "Eliza Intro 100": "Lorenzo... Are you there, darling? It's been such a long time. What's the special occasion?",
 "Eliza Intro 1000": "There's no bigger sin than stealing from charity. Now, imagine if the public found out...",
 "Eliza Intro 1100": "So you're jumping at the chance to blackmail me.",
 "Eliza Intro 1200": "It doesn't pay to underestimate your partners, does it, darling? ",
 "Eliza Intro 1300": "I take it you're not asking for a song.",
 "Eliza Intro 1400": "We both have our secrets to protect. I believe these two problems share one solution: You.",
 "Eliza Intro 1500": "Do you expect me to hunt the Skullgirl? Honey, I'm sorry, but that's just not my scene. My place \nis on the stage.",
 "Eliza Intro 1600": "Don't underestimate us. We know damn well what you're capable of. You have a knack for tracking blood -- just like we do for talent.\n",
 "Eliza Intro 1700": "Of course, we wouldn't send you out alone.",
 "Eliza Intro 1800": "That's where I come in!",
 "Eliza Intro 1900": "Cerebella here will ensure that everything goes smoothly.",
 "Eliza Intro 200": "Welcome, Eliza. I'll be speaking on my father's behalf tonight.",
 "Eliza Intro 2000": "You can count on me!",
 "Eliza Intro 2100": "And don't worry, Vitale. We'll nab that cat if we see her, too.",
 "Eliza Intro 2200": "That's my girl.",
 "Eliza Intro 2300": "As for you, Eliza... If you fail, we're going to have a conversation neither of us wants.",
 "Eliza Intro 2400": "Kill her! Kill her and bring me her heart, or you are finished in this town. Do you hear me? \nI will ruin you!",
 "Eliza Intro 2500": "Oh, Lorenzo. I hardly recognized you. You've grown so... distinguished. ",
 "Eliza Intro 2600": "At least now I can see why you're so desperate.",
 "Eliza Intro 2700": "You want to see desperate? Desperate is when I rip out your skeleton and see if it's more useful to me than you are!",
 "Eliza Intro 2800": "You should hurry before it comes to that.",
 "Eliza Intro 2900": "Forget the blood scandal -- your fans would be in mourning.",
 "Eliza Intro 300": "Forgive me for being terse, but as you may realize, our business has two pressing problems.",
 "Eliza Intro 3000": "The Medicis are breathing down our necks, but all they send along is this little girl? \nIs this supposed to be a joke?",
 "Eliza Intro 3100": "The Skullgirl must have made quite a dent in their numbers if they're forced to recruit from the circus.",
 "Eliza Intro 3200": "Vitale could have sent anyone! I'm all it takes. You'll learn that the hard way if you aren't careful.",
 "Eliza Intro 3300": "That Living Weapon of yours may be a powerhouse in a hat, but that strength never belonged \nto you.",
 "Eliza Intro 3400": "What're you talking about? It's not that different from you and your Parasite!",
 "Eliza Intro 3500": "Hush, hon. I'm impressed that you aren't completely in the dark, but I'm more interested in getting this job over with.",
 "Eliza Intro 3600": "Ma'am! I believe that we may have found our first lead.",
 "Eliza Intro 3700": "Too right. Somethin' smells of the grave, that's for sure. ",
 "Eliza Intro 3800": "Come. We have work to do.\n",
 "Eliza Intro 3900": "I can't believe we got in a fight with the princess, of all people! We must look like a pair of hooligans.",
 "Eliza Intro 400": "You've heard about the latest Skullgirl, I presume.\n",
 "Eliza Intro 4000": "If she turned out anything like her father, I would not worry about it.",
 "Eliza Intro 4100": "Besides, it was entirely her fault for lumping us in with those mindless, slouching zombies. You would think royalty would recognize the value of proper posture!",
 "Eliza Intro 4200": "My, my... I thought all the dead were under the control of the Skullgirl -- yet you two \ndon't seem to be.",
 "Eliza Intro 4300": "Finally, someone who pays attention!",
 "Eliza Intro 4400": "We're not under her control. Thankfully, she's nowhere near, either.",
 "Eliza Intro 4500": "What is this, some kind of ventriloquist act? The girl's mouth ain't even moving.\n",
 "Eliza Intro 4600": "Trust me, I've seen better. Why are we even listening to this girl, anyway? Time's a-wastin'.",
 "Eliza Intro 4700": "W-wait a second! I thought you looked familiar... You're Eliza, aren't you?",
 "Eliza Intro 4800": "I've loved your singing since I was a little girl. And you still look as beautiful as you did then!",
 "Eliza Intro 4900": "That's so flattering of you, sugar. You were... quite famous yourself.",
 "Eliza Intro 500": "A little. As much as anyone else. ",
 "Eliza Intro 5000": "But I'm more interested in whether your friend remembers me.",
 "Eliza Intro 5100": "Sekhmet!?",
 "Eliza Intro 5200": "That means... It can't be! You should be dead!",
 "Eliza Intro 5300": "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you nuts?! You're going to blow your cover!",
 "Eliza Intro 5400": "Oh, don't worry. He's known me for a long time, sweetie.",
 "Eliza Intro 5500": "Leviathan, I know we've had our differences. But I must know if I can count on your support in these troubled times.",
 "Eliza Intro 5600": "Surely you've thought of reclaiming your rightful place as a Theon, just as I have. Or has the proud serpent I knew been reduced to a worm digging his way through a rotten apple?",
 "Eliza Intro 5700": "My place is with those who share my ideals. Together, we protect what we can -- that has always been where I take my pride.",
 "Eliza Intro 5800": "And look where pride has led you. My life, on the other hand, has been rosy.",
 "Eliza Intro 5900": "Only by hiding your true nature. But I can see that it has re-emerged.",
 "Eliza Intro 600": "You're doing such a good job keeping her victims under wraps, dear. All I know is it's like poor Selene all over again.",
 "Eliza Intro 6000": "Whatever purpose has awakened you, you must be stopped!",
 "Eliza Intro 6100": "Someone who knows our lady, but not well enough to stay out of her way?",
 "Eliza Intro 6200": "That's cute. Time for your return trip to the underworld, worm!",
 "Eliza Intro 6300": "Leviathan, who in the world are these people?",
 "Eliza Intro 6400": "The diva you so admire is nothing more than a blood-drenched idol. In our time she called herself Neferu, but we knew her as the Crimson Scourge!",
 "Eliza Intro 6500": "The others? Mere lackeys.",
 "Eliza Intro 6600": "Hey! Wait a --",
 "Eliza Intro 6700": "No one has called me that in ages! It brings back such beautiful memories. ",
 "Eliza Intro 6800": "It is past time for us to catch up, Leviathan. It's been far too long.",
 "Eliza Intro 700": "You have my sympathies, but I don't do funerals.\n",
 "Eliza Intro 800": "That brings us to our second problem... The racket you're running.",
 "Eliza Intro 900": "You think we didn't know? You've been skimming from all those blood drives, Eliza.",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 100": "You might have beaten me, but you can't beat the entire Medici family...! ",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 1000": "Now... It's time to find her. ",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 200": "Sadly, they don't talk about me in the history books. \nBut if you saw my resume, you'd know I was overqualified for that little job.",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 300": "Just try it. You're nobody -- just some nutjob with a Parasite!",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 400": "That lack of perspective...",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 500": "...is something I'll have to fix about the world.",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 600": "Well, I'll not miss her.",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 700": "I do so love blood fresh from the source... There's no comparison, even after tasting that of an immortal.",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 800": " I wonder what the blood of a Skullgirl tastes like...",
 "Eliza Post-Cerebella 900": "It would be easier to let her keep tearing at the Medici, but I'm not in this to let opportunities slip by. \nNot when I could claim her heart.",
 "Eliza Post-Double 100": "Lamia, it is time to join your daughters. ",
 "Eliza Post-Double 200": "If it weren't consumed by a vendetta, the Skull Heart could have been useful to me.",
 "Eliza Post-Double 300": "But like the ghost that haunts it, it no longer matters!",
 "Eliza Post-Double 400": "This is not over. No matter how long you avoid death, there will come a reckoning!",
 "Eliza Post-Double 500": "And you are done clinging to this world.",
 "Eliza Post-Double 600": "Come, my servants. It is time to retire, relax, and to plan. ",
 "Eliza Post-Double 700": "Settle one of your old rivalries, ma'am?",
 "Eliza Post-Double 800": "You could say that. It's ancient history. Whoever she was... well, it hardly makes a difference now.",
 "Eliza Post-Double 900": "Good enough for me. All I need to know is that it's party time!",
 "Eliza Post-Filia 100": "Predictable. She is not half the vessel Delilah was -- and even Delilah was unworthy of you. ",
 "Eliza Post-Filia 200": "The years have been cruel to you... But there's still time. Think about what you could become. Consider what I will achieve -- with or without you.",
 "Eliza Post-Filia 300": "No, stop...!",
 "Eliza Post-Filia 400": "Not now, kid. Not now... We been beat. We gotta regroup.",
 "Eliza Post-Filia 500": "I know her. She ain't gonna wish on the Heart, so the one thing we got is time.",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 100": "Squigly... No...!",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 1000": "As much as I enjoy these games, their scale is far too small.",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 1100": "It is time for a new kingdom, and a new age! This world so badly needs a wake-up call.",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 200": "Leviathan... Filia... I'm sorry...",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 300": "You fought better than I expected, but death is the fate of all mortals.",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 400": "Albus, take her to the crypt. If the Skull Heart returns, she will awaken -- a crude alarm we can make use of.",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 500": "I'll find her a guest room. It'll be cramped, but... those chambers have a certain old-world charm.",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 600": "As for you, Filia... Samson deserves a better host... One who can help him see the world more clearly.",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 700": "Don't you touch her!",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 800": "I don't believe you're in any position to do a thing about it.",
 "Eliza Post-FiliaSquigly 900": "But for now, we'll let you keep him company until we find someone more suitable.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 100": "You really thought you could win, Leviathan? You've picked up some tricks, but still...",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1000": "I can assure you that interaction was strictly professional.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1010": "Besides, you were the one who suspected them, dear.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1100": "It was pretty obvious you wanted to catch up with your little buddy, there. ",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1200": "Your drama is not my drama. Understand?",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1300": "I think this one needs to learn some manners.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1400": "Don't mind her, Horace. We were all that young, once.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1500": "In fact, she's a surprising amount of fun! It's already been such an eventful evening. ",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1600": "Albus, the scent of blood is in the air. Start the car!",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1700": "You got it, boss.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1800": "Man, what a dump! Why are we out here? This is the last place we'd find the Skullgirl.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 1900": "Because I smell something delectable... An aromatic trail of blood from one who should be but a mummy by now.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 200": "It's a miracle you're moving at all, attached to that dead weight.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 2000": "Well, all I smell is fish. And all I see is a crappy-looking Dagonian restaurant.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 2100": "Probably because that stupid hat blocks your view. Not like you'd know good food when you see it, anyway!",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 2200": "It's the cat burglar Vitale wants! Eliza, we've gotta grab her!",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 2300": "Hey, you! You better hand over the Life Gem you stole from us!",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 2400": "Finders, keepers! Aren't five-finger discounts the Medici way?",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 2500": "Life Gem? Great Osiris! Of all the stories... That was Lorenzo's secret? And now he's lost it to a thief! How funny.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 2600": "Tell me, is that the seasoning that makes your blood so piquant?  I'm just aching to get a draught, may Bastet forgive me.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 2700": "I don't think so, crazy cat lady. All you're getting is hospital food!",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 300": "I... I don't think we can beat them...",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 400": "Patience, my lady. For now, we must exercise discretion and withdraw.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 500": "You ain't going nowhere, dead meat!",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 600": "How does she move like that?! She ain't that fast.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 700": "From what I could see, she and that Parasite appeared to be moving you.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 800": "A talent I didn't know they had, and one that could be useful... if Leviathan understood who to serve.",
 "Eliza Post-Intro 900": "Try and remember that you're not the one in charge here, lady!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 100": "Pah. No blood at all -- just more bone. ",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1000": "What... is that thing...!?",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1100": "It was you... You murdered them...!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1200": "Aeon... Venus...",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1300": "You killed... my daughters...! You... destroyed my kingdom...!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1400": "Queen Lamia...? Whatever it is, it carries her grudge.",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1500": "Before this thing pulls itself together, I need to find a way out... But how?!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1600": "I see now... ",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1700": "You never should have let me reach this place.",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1800": "Come on, boys!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 1900": "What... through that?",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 200": "Skull Heart! You should have chosen a livelier host.",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 2000": "You want to take your chances up here?!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 2100": "No... NO!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 300": "...I've... found... you...",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 400": "What?",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 500": "The Crimson... Scourge...",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 600": "...NEFERU...!!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 700": "Boss! Are you alright?!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 800": "Betrayer! You alone shall never be forgiven!",
 "Eliza Post-Marie 900": "Keep it away from Eliza!",
 "Eliza Post-MF 100": "I guess it's a cat-eat-cat world... ",
 "Eliza Post-MF 1000": "Oh, but we're here. Excellent.",
 "Eliza Post-MF 200": "I forgot how sweet the hunt was. I feel more alive than I have in years!",
 "Eliza Post-MF 300": "Oh, boys. Can you help wrap up my leftovers? I'll be taking her to go.",
 "Eliza Post-MF 400": "Let meowt! Your trunk is for your JUNK, not me!",
 "Eliza Post-MF 500": "Oh, we ain't lettin' the cat out of this doggie bag.",
 "Eliza Post-MF 600": "That takes care of that! But I wonder how they'll get the gem out of her...",
 "Eliza Post-MF 700": "I'd worry about myself, if I were you. \nThe Life Gem is a forgotten myth, and your boss will want to keep it that way.",
 "Eliza Post-MF 800": "Watch it! I have the life that I do now because of Vitale. You don't know a thing about the Medici!",
 "Eliza Post-MF 900": "Your employers maintain a generous image, but if you knew the things they'll do for a profit...",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 100": "Why are we at your place? \n",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 1000": "You'll regret crossing paths with the Crimson Scourge!",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 1100": "Cerebella, dear... I fear our duet ends here. ",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 200": "Oh, dear. Did you really think I'd hand over a scrumptious little treat like her to that \nwithered-up old fool Lorenzo?",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 300": "Not really. I sorta thought you might double-cross us. ",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 400": "Oh, my. It looks like you're a better judge of character than I thought.",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 500": "I did consider going along with Vitale's game when he twisted my arm, but sitting on the sidelines, never to taste the thrill of victory? Pathetic.",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 600": "I'm keeping my cute new drinking fountain. But don't worry -- Skullgirl or no, your friends won't be around to miss her.",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 700": "There's no way I'll let you do this! ",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 800": "I've been waiting for an excuse to shut you up.",
 "Eliza Pre-Cerebella 900": "Same here, clown! Let's go!",
 "Eliza Pre-Double 100": "Ah... Much better.",
 "Eliza Pre-Double 200": "You see? Everything that belongs to you was always destined to be mine.",
 "Eliza Pre-Double 300": "All you've done is trap yourself in my world. Your suffering will be unending! I will shatter you until not a trace remains!",
 "Eliza Pre-Double 400": "I think not. I'm the one in my element here, shadow of a queen.",
 "Eliza Pre-Double 500": "It reminds me of that Feral's blood... Perhaps not as rich, but I have more than I need. Far more.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 100": "All this blood in the air makes me nostalgic... I couldn't ask for a better invitation.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1000": "Samson. After so long, I was hoping you'd had a change of heart.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1100": "But it must be fate that we met tonight, of all nights. Help me teach these cattle who their gods are again.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1200": "You're the reason they hate us... The reason Delilah had to die.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1300": "You're the one who ruined everything we had!",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1400": "So you say, but Delilah is in the distant past. Either way, she'd be only a memory by now.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1500": "You could have an eternal queen, yet you cling to that phantom...",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1600": "So, uhhh... Question!  Do I need to understand any of this? All I got was, she's evil.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1700": "Got it in one, kid. Back in the day, her schemes just about trashed the whole damn world.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1800": "Knowing this broad, the only reason she's here now is that she's gonna do it again using \nthe Skull Heart.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 1900": "Humankind twists the facts of our lives into fairy tales. We grace them with our power as their champions, and they call us Parasites or reduce our brethren to mere tools.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 200": "Yeah, I always feel so cozy in places like this. I don't know -- there's just something homey about the atmosphere.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 2000": "I'm just taking what has always belonged to us, dear.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 2100": "I know you're one self-obsessed piece of work, but... things only turned out that way \nbecause of you.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 2200": "And no matter how you pretty it up, you're still talking about wrecking the world and enslaving people.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 2300": "I think I'm in over my head, but... Samson, we've got to stop her!",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 2400": "Ain't happening, love.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 2500": "Step away from Madame Eliza.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 2600": "How amusing. Do you really think you can stop me, child? ",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 2700": "Let's gauge your worth as Samson's host.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 300": "I just don't get you two sometimes.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 400": "Who's there?!",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 500": "That depends. Do you take confessions?",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 600": "Neferu...",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 700": "So Leviathan wasn't just foolin'.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 800": "You should be dead. You deserve to be dead.",
 "Eliza Pre-Filia 900": "But it ain't all bad. I did always dream about bein' the cause!",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 100": "Mmm. Eventually the Medici will realize I don't have the Heart.",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 1000": "I admire your resolve, but you must know the true strength of a Theon lies in the bond with their avatar.",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 1100": "That being the case... It's more like four against one. But think a little before you mistake that for an advantage.",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 1200": "All you are is a monster from the inside out!",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 1300": "You are strong... and scary. But Samson is strong, too, and I can handle scary!",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 1400": "Only a perfect fool could fail to recognize the face of divinity.",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 200": "Before that happens, I could use that delicious cat to lure Lorenzo out. Or...",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 300": "Bath time's over, Neferu! Time to dry you out!",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 400": "There is no way we will remain idle as you spin your web once again.",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 500": "We've come to put an end to your machinations!",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 600": "I expected you two to show up, though this is perhaps sooner than I had anticipated. \nLet me guess... The corpse doesn't have much time left.",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 700": "This won't take long... it's four against two.",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 800": "Don't we count?",
 "Eliza Pre-FiliaSquigly 900": "I don't think they care about us, friend.",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 100": "Odd, the scent ends here... and this place is dry as a bone.",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 1000": "I hope your lapdog knows he will be buried with his owner.",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 200": "Don't go chewing on anything, Albus.",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 300": "It's you who'd be on the menu, birdbrain.",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 400": "It makes no difference. The power coursing through that heart is all that I need... I must thank the Medicis for sending me this way.",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 500": "You work for Lorenzo Medici? ",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 600": "We had a fleeting association. It's over. ",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 700": "His stink won't wash off so quickly. This chamber is lined with the corpses of Medici scum. \nI welcome a chance to add another. ",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 800": "Girl, you are making a mess you can't clean up! You should have stuck to housework, love.",
 "Eliza Pre-Marie 900": "Now, now. Her overconfidence only makes my job easier. ",
 "Filia Ending A 100": "I know enough about myself now to know that memories don't matter -- what's done is done, \nand it's time to move on.",
 "Filia Ending A 1000": "Nice to meet you!",
 "Filia Ending A 200": "But, Carol... What happened to her is my fault, isn't it? Even if I can't remember it. So...",
 "Filia Ending A 300": "...Skull Heart!\nI wish for Painwheel to have a normal life again!",
 "Filia Ending A 400": "Your wish is pure... almost. Healing the broken girl is noble, yet you seek absolution for your forgotten guilt.",
 "Filia Ending A 500": "Your transformation will be slow -- make the most of it.",
 "Filia Ending A 600": "Quiet now, everyone!",
 "Filia Ending A 700": "Before we begin, I'd like to introduce our new transfer student, Miss... Painwheel?\nHmm, must be foreign.",
 "Filia Ending A 800": "Hi, everyone! My name is Painwheel!",
 "Filia Ending A 900": "I just moved here from the Labs, and I like sewing, and puppies and walks on the beach!",
 "Filia Ending B 01": "Samson's been trying to hide something from me. Maybe to protect me, maybe to manipulate me... I need to know.",
 "Filia Ending B 02": "I lost my memories when Samson attached himself to me... so I should get them back when he comes off, right?",
 "Filia Ending B 03": "...Skull Heart!",
 "Filia Ending B 04": "I wish for...",
 "Filia Ending B 05": "No, Filia!",
 "Filia Ending B 06": "Don't! You asked me to...!",
 "Filia Ending B 07": "...my memory to return!",
 "Filia Ending B 08": "An interesting choice.",
 "Filia Ending B 10": "Neither your memories nor you death will allow you to escape your fate.",
 "Filia Ending B 11": "The fate that befalls all who misuse my power...",
 "Filia Ending B 9": "...A selfish choice.",
 "Filia Ending Choice 100": "Well, this is it, kid...\nWhatcha gonna wish for?",
 "Filia Ending Choice 200": "I need to make this wish count...",
 "Filia Ending Choice 300": "\"I know enough about myself...\"",
 "Filia Ending Choice 400": "\"I want to remember everything...\"",
 "Filia Intro 100": "Well, well, well... What have we here? What say I buy you a real drink, sister?",
 "Filia Intro 1000": "Anyway... where to next?",
 "Filia Intro 1100": "We need leads on the Skull Heart -- I've got to wish my memories back.",
 "Filia Intro 1200": "It's definitely in New Meridian... I can feel it.",
 "Filia Intro 1300": "With all these Skullgirl rumors floatin' around, I bet we can find a lead just by lookin' for trouble.\n",
 "Filia Intro 1400": "...Fine, we'll do it your way.",
 "Filia Intro 200": "...We've already got a drink, thanks.",
 "Filia Intro 300": "Uh... that's quite the deep voice you've got there, little lady. But it's cool.",
 "Filia Intro 400": "...That's it! You had a chance to walk away!",
 "Filia Intro 500": "A Parasite?!",
 "Filia Intro 600": "Sorry about that! He can get a little carried away.",
 "Filia Intro 700": "Samson... You've got to stop doing that. You're drawing too much attention to us!",
 "Filia Intro 800": "Hmph, that creep was asking for it.\nNo one lays a hand on my host... No one.",
 "Filia Intro 900": "I know you mean well, but I can take care of myself.",
 "Filia Post-Middle 100": "Hurry, Filia! Let's get out of here before that thing wakes up!",
 "Filia Post-Middle 1000": "Just great... No talking you out of this now, huh?",
 "Filia Post-Middle 1100": "Sorry Samson, but I need answers -- we're going to follow her.",
 "Filia Post-Middle 200": "Samson... who was I?\nWhy does this poor girl know me?",
 "Filia Post-Middle 300": "I, er... don't know.\nIt's clearly insane -- I wouldn't worry about it...",
 "Filia Post-Middle 400": "...Dammit, she's getting up! We need to get out of here!",
 "Filia Post-Middle 500": "F-Filia... It's me! Carol!",
 "Filia Post-Middle 600": "...Carol?",
 "Filia Post-Middle 700": "Carol? Is that really you?",
 "Filia Post-Middle 800": "WAIT, CAROL! DON'T GO!",
 "Filia Post-Middle 900": "...She's gone.",
 "Filia Pre-Endboss 100": "Are you sure about this, kid? A Skullgirl is no laughing matter.",
 "Filia Pre-Endboss 200": "We're strong now -- a real team. Even so, I ain't so sure we stand a chance against her.",
 "Filia Pre-Endboss 300": "We've got to try, Samson. I need answers, and this is the only way.",
 "Filia Pre-Endboss 400": "Filia, we meet again... But why?",
 "Filia Pre-Endboss 500": "We've met before?\nTell me, Skullgirl... who am I?",
 "Filia Pre-Endboss 600": "I... only know one thing about you, Filia, and it is the only thing I need to know.",
 "Filia Pre-Endboss 700": "Medici blood flows through your veins...",
 "Filia Pre-Endboss 800": "...The blood I have sworn to spill!",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 100": "Another failed experiment. Time to shut you down, Painwheel!",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 200": "Leave her alone!",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 300": "Filia? You remember me!",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 400": "Hmph, the amnesiac finally rears her pretty... heads.\nWhat should we do, Double?",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 500": "The Skull Heart can answer all of your questions, dear Filia -- who you are, why you're here... what you're running from.",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 600": "It can do that, and so much more. Anything you desire.",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 700": "The Skull Heart...? Here?",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 800": "Indeed. The Skullgirl herself awaits below.",
 "Filia Pre-Midboss 900": "...But only if you prove yourself worthy!",
 "Filia Pre-Middle 100": "FIL-I-AAAAAAAA!",
 "Filia Pre-Middle 200": "...Get ready, Filia! I don't think we can get away from that thing.",
 "Filia Pre-Middle 300": "Ready, Samson!\nBut why does it know me!?",
 "Fukua End 100": "...!?",
 "Fukua End 200": "Now I'M Filia.",
 "Fukua Intro 100": "Zzz...",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending A 01": "If that hell-thing was right, I'm on easy street!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending A 02": "SKULL HEART!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending A 03": "I wish I had my old friends back!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending A 04": "Your misbegotten guilt is exceeded only by your gullibility -- no magic can stand before my own.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending A 05": "Your selfishness is a stain on your soul, and the doorway to your swift demise.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending A 06": "Your friends shall be returned to you... and serve you, Skullgirl.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 09": "What!? Who would dare do such a thing!?",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 10": "Nobody know, but people saw those Mafia sneaking around!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 100": "I... I can't do it.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1000": "Well, better go check in on everyone back in Little Innsmouth... and get some food.\nI'm exhausted.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 101": "I have so many new friends in Little Innsmouth!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 11": "The River King hired a detective to find out. His name is Irvin, and left his card -- maybe you can help him?",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1100": "Mew Nyan, I'm back!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 12": "Don't worry, Yu-Wan - I'll find them!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1200": "I'm starving! It's time for that free meal you promised. Bring me the full Lucky Family Banquet!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 13": "But first... Can I at least get an order of bao for the road? I'm seriously starving here.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1300": "Nadia! There you are!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1400": "Minette has been kidnapped! All the River King's daughters! And others, too!\nLittle Innsmouth is in a panic!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1500": "What!? Who would dare do such a thing!?",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1600": "That's where I come in.\nMy name is Irvin. I'm a private detective.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1700": "The River King hired me to find his daughters, so if you have any information that might help, \nI'd appreciate if you shared it.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1800": "The proprietor of this fine establishment was telling me that there have been numerous mafia sightings in the area recently.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 1900": "That's the only lead we've got, but kidnapping certainly fits the mob's M.O.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 200": "...Terrible as it was, what happened happened, and made me who I am today.\nChanging that would be... wrong.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 2000": "We're at a loss as to why they'd be targeting Dagonian women, though.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 2100": "The Mafia...!\nMaybe Marie had it right all along.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 2200": "Irvin, I'm coming with you.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 2300": "Those black-hearted bastards already took one family from me, and like hell I'm going to let them do it again.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 2400": "Hang in there, Minette -- we'll find you!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 300": "That's what the Skull Heart is here for, isn't it? To tempt us into doing the wrong thing!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 400": "Marie said her wish was similar, and look how she turned out!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 500": "This stops here!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 600": "A temporary setback!",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 700": "This world will always be cursed by a Skull Heart. And so shall it always be cursed with Skullgirls.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 800": "...Until this world exists no more.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending B 900": "Hmph, all that for a life lesson?\nHow annoying.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending Choice 100": "All right, this is it.",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending Choice A": "“Time to reunite the old gang!”",
 "Ms. Fortune Ending Choice B": "“I don't need this, after all...”",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 100": "You hear the news? The Skullgirl's been going after all those families in Maplecrest...",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1000": "Is everything OK over here?\nAre these guys bugging you, Minette?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1100": "Go find yourself a sandbox, kitty -- we're just havin' a friendly chat with the little minnow here.",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1200": "Leave. Now, or I'll throw you out myself.",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1300": "Can't you take a clue, you flea-bitten tart!?\nClearly you don't know who you're messing with.",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1400": "Ha, did you see that? That stupid cat didn't stand a chance.",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1500": "What the...!?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1600": "Nevermind her -- we found what we were looking for! Let's get back and tell Vitale!",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1700": "You OK, Minette? They didn't hurt you, did they?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1800": "That was... AMAZING!\nWhat would I do without you?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 1900": "Thanks for scaring them off, Nadia. Your next dinner is on me!",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 200": "Looks like this new Skullgirl's got a bone to pick with the boss.\nWhere has he gone, anyway? Think the rumors of him gettin' sick are true?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 2000": "Actually, I think it's time I make my move and follow them.",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 2100": "I've got to catch me a Skullgirl, and it sounds like mafia goons are the purr-fect bait to draw her out.",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 2200": "Sounds very dangerous. Be careful out there!\nYou're like family to us, you know!",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 2300": "Nadia... do you really think the Skull Heart can bring your friends back?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 2400": "There's only one way to find out!",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 2500": "See you around, Mew Nyan!\nAnd give my regards to your dad, Minette!",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 300": "Hold up... Look, there she is! That fishfolk dame we were sent to find!",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 400": "...Hey, girlie! Can we get some service over here?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 500": "Yes? May I help you, sir?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 600": "Hey now... you're quite the dish. I'd like to eat YOU up.",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 700": "Why don't you swim over here with a couple of free drinks... and then we hit the town?",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 800": "I... I'm sorry, but I need to work.",
 "Ms. Fortune Intro 900": "You know... you are pretty cute.\n...For a stinkin' gill-girl.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 100": "...I underestimated you, but I've seen all that I need to see.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 1000": "So the Skullgirl is hiding out at the Grand Cathedral, is she?",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 1100": "Never was one for churches, but here I'll make an exception.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 1200": "...We'll be back together soon enough, guys.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 200": "And I'm sure the analysis of this blood will prove most enlightening.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 300": "You just don't stop, do you?",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 400": "Lady Valentine, the Skullgirl has requested your presence at the Cathedral.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 500": "A nurse and a nun? Ha, where have I heard this joke before...?",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 600": "I'll be there soon, Double -- return and let Marie know that I found Lorenzo. His minions led me right to him.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 700": "...I just had to stop and perform a little experiment on our feline friend here.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 800": "...Very well.",
 "Ms. Fortune Post-Middle 900": "Take care, kitty -- we'll have a follow-up visit as soon as these tests come back from the lab!",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 100": "All right, Skullgirl -- you know why I'm here.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 200": "I do.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 300": "So, no offense, but you're the last thing standing between me and my family, so let's get this show on the road!",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 400": "I too have lost much to the Medicis. Do you not seek vengeance?\nWishes such as yours rarely turn out well.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 500": "I've got to try -- the Fishbone Gang raised me, protected me and taught me everything I know. \nThe least I can do is return the favor.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 600": "Your instincts are admirable -- my wish was also to protect my friends.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 700": "Look, I'm gonna have to stop you before you get to the “We're a lot alike, you and I” bit.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 800": "I've come too far to turn around, so it's time to claw that heart out of you.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Endboss 900": "...So be it.\nI hope your wish turns out well.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 100": "So this is the Grand Cathedral, eh?",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 1000": "The nun is your lab assistant?\nHate to break it to you lady, but you're not gonna get much science out of this one.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 1001": "Your experiments will have to wait, Valentine -- she is a candidate.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 1100": "A candidate, you say? Even better!",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 1200": "C'mon, kitty -- the doctor will see you now!",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 200": "Meow what's a Skullgirl like you doing in a place like this?",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 300": "She followed me home, Double!\nCan I keep her?",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 400": "...You again! Don't you have an appointment with the Skullgirl?",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 500": "Indeed I did, but I'm afraid we've got a scheduling conflict.\nAs it turns out, YOU'VE got an appointment on my dissection table... right about now.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 600": "Let's not be late, or I'll have to get my spray bottle.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 700": "You couldn't beat me before, so what makes you think you can now?",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 800": "Yes, my previous experiment was a failure, but I've got my lab assistant to help this time around.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Midboss 900": "...May the Trinity have mercy on this poor, lost soul.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Middle 100": "Well, well... what have we here?\nThat's quite the body you've got there, kitty.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Middle 200": "...Er, sorry, creepy lady, I'm not interested.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Middle 300": "Oh, don't get the wrong idea -- I was just admiring your scars! You've been cut clean-through several times over!",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Middle 400": "No one could survive that... yet here you are, walking, talking and shedding.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Middle 500": "Whatever's animating you could be invaluable to my research.",
 "Ms. Fortune Pre-Middle 600": "...Let's perform an autopsy and see what makes you tick!",
 "Painwheel Ending A 100": "No, I will not be enslaved by you, Lab 0 or ANYONE!",
 "Painwheel Ending A 200": "Your freedom is an illusion! This changes nothing...!",
 "Painwheel Ending A 300": "...It's over. I can go home.",
 "Painwheel Ending A 400": "*knock, knock*",
 "Painwheel Ending A 500": "Mom, Dad... it's me.",
 "Painwheel Ending A 600": "M-MONSTER!\nGET OUT OF HERE, MONSTER!",
 "Painwheel Ending A 700": "Painwheel, return to Lab 0 -- we have much to discuss.",
 "Painwheel Ending A 800": "Do you really think you can control me...?",
 "Painwheel Ending A 900": "The truth is... you're next!",
 "Painwheel Ending B 02": "Free from the needs of the mind, body and soul.",
 "Painwheel Ending B 03": "Free of memory, reason and morals.",
 "Painwheel Ending B 04": "You shall be rage incarnate, a force of nature... a Skullgirl unlike any before.",
 "Painwheel Ending Choice 100": "The Skull Heart... this is why my life was taken from me.",
 "Painwheel Ending Choice 200": "You poor, miserable child... I can return your life to you, and so much more.",
 "Painwheel Ending Choice A": "“DESTROY!”",
 "Painwheel Ending Choice B": "“...FREEDOM?”",
 "Painwheel Intro 100": "...Soul contamination stabilized...",
 "Painwheel Intro 200": "...Begin implanting the control mechanism...",
 "Painwheel Intro 300": "...Her body seems to have fully assimilated the Skullgirl's blood, Doctor...",
 "Painwheel Intro 400": "Implantation complete. No signs of rejection, Doctor.",
 "Painwheel Intro 500": "Good. Establishing control... now.",
 "Painwheel Intro 600": "OBEY LAB 0",
 "Painwheel Intro 700": "FIND THE SKULLGIRL AND DESTROY HER",
 "Painwheel Intro 800": "RETRIEVE THE SKULL HEART AND RETURN IT TO LAB 0",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 100": "AUGHHHH!",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 1000": "I'll be waiting... and so will the Skullgirl. See you there!",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 200": "...What? You're still here?\nLeave at once!",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 300": "I said NO!",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 400": "Impossible... How could you overcome a Command Protocol?",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 500": "That shred of a soul we left you with shouldn't be enough to fight Brain Drain's control.",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 600": "I can feel the Skullgirl on you, Valentine!",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 700": "Now that just won't do -- it would seem I've been hanging around Marie too long and have been... tainted with her ethereal stink.",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 800": "The Skullgirl blood in you must be reacting to that.",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 900": "But, I wonder... Perhaps there's more to that blood than we knew.",
 "Painwheel Post-Middle 901": "Let's conduct a little experiment -- come to the Grand Cathedral of the Divine Trinity.",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 100": "Excellent... you're ready!\nI had my doubts, but I think it's time you challenge Marie.",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 1000": "This is my choice!",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 1100": "Brain Drain... Valentine... This cursed blood within me... I don't give a damn!\nTearing you apart is the only true path to freedom!",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 200": "Go! The Skullgirl awaits in the catacombs below.",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 300": "Why should I listen to you!?",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 400": "Do you want freedom? Do you want to reclaim the boring, humdrum life we stole from you?",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 500": "Until the Skullgirl is defeated, no one is truly free. And you have the strength to stop her.",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 600": "You're right...",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 601": "...But don't think for a second this is over, Valentine! I will find you.",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 700": "Skullgirl, I'm here to destroy you!",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 800": "How curious: evil people made you into a monster, but you broke free of their control...",
 "Painwheel Pre-Endboss 900": "...Yet you still wish to do their bidding?",
 "Painwheel Pre-Midboss 100": "You made it -- excellent!",
 "Painwheel Pre-Midboss 1000": "No, leave her to me!",

 "Peacock Ending A 800": "That makes me... happy.",
 "Peacock Ending A 900": "Tell you what -- I'll pick up where you left off. Now that I beat you, saved the day... and it's rerun season... I don't have much to do. So why not?",

 "Peacock Ending B 09": "Uh... well, can you make everyone in the world turn into adorable puppies?",
 "Peacock Ending B 10": "No, I can not.",
 "Peacock Ending B 11": "And, even if I could, I would not.",
 "Peacock Ending B 12": "I fight all the way here and I can't even get what I want?",
 "Peacock Ending B 13": "Some wish-granting doodad you turned out to be.",
 "Peacock Ending B 14": "Hey, why do you only grant wishes to women, anyway?",
 "Peacock Ending B 15": "Are you a dude?",
 "Peacock Ending B 16": "...Look, I didn't make the rules.",
 "Peacock Ending B 17": "Are you going to make a wish or...",
 "Peacock Ending B 18": "...And what's with that seven year thing, anyway?",
 "Peacock Ending B 19": "Seems pretty arbitrary, if you ask me.",
 "Peacock Ending B 20": "Something about the alignment of the stars, I think.",
 "Peacock Ending B 21": "Are you going to make a real wish or not?",
 "Peacock Ending B 22": "Ooh, ooh! What if...",
 "Peacock Ending B 23": "...Dammit, where is Double?",
 "Peacock Ending B 24": "She's supposed to keep people like you away from me.",
 "Peacock Ending B 25": "Oh, so now you're too good for me, are you?",
 "Peacock Ending B 26": "Maybe if your legend had been a little more specific I'd know these things!",
 "Peacock Ending B 27": "...Really?",
 "Peacock Ending B 28": "Do you know how long it took us to even get this far?",
 "Peacock Ending B 29": "Centuries of whisper campaigns and information control!",
 "Peacock Ending B 30": "I must say, I've been doing this for thousands of years, and you are the worst wisher I've seen yet.",
 "Peacock Ending Choice 100": "Told you I'd win!\nBut I appreciate you trying to put up a fight!",

 "Peacock Intro 500": "Two synthetic Parasites? Regulating the soul contamination must be difficult.",
 "Peacock Intro 600": "Indeed, but with the proper Theonite balance, I think we could graft even more onto future subjects.",
 "Peacock Intro 700": "The Argus System not only lets her see everything, but the eyes also generate powerful Z-rays \nat the precise wavelength needed to disrupt a Skullgirl's essence.",

 "Squigly Pre-Endboss 100": "Think about what you are doing...\nLorenzo is on the run, and his empire is vulnerable and in disarray.\nDon't throw away our only chance to break his grip on New Meridian!",

 "Squigly Pre-Midboss 100": "Your Parasite...  it's unusual, how it blocks my control.\nYet your connection to the Heart is strong... through it, I can sense that you, too, seek revenge against the Medicis. And against the man that silenced you.\n\nWhy did you find me instead of following your own path?",
 "Squigly Pre-Midboss 200": "I believe you're a good person, but the Heart's power is poison.\nEven when you used it to save those people, I could feel its hate growing inside you.",

 "Squigly Pre-Middle 1800": "I'd say she looks like she ditched her own funeral, but she's not dressed nice enough for it!",
 "Squigly Pre-Middle 1900": "I beg your pardon!",
 "Squigly Pre-Middle 200": "That, I do not know -- but I do know that it still reeks of the Medicis.",
 "Squigly Pre-Middle 2000": "You don't wanna make friends with the undead, kid.\nCan't trust 'em when there's a Skullgirl pulling their strings.",
 "Squigly Pre-Middle 2100": "And they seemed so nice, too.",

 "Squigly Pre-Middle 800": "Sienna Contiello -- but, please, call me Squigly. The pleasure is all mine.\nThe city's changed so much while I was gone... Tell me -- do you live around here?",
 "Squigly Pre-Middle 900": "No...  At least, I don't think so.\nI lost my memory, so Samson is helping me look for the Skull Heart to wish it back.",

 "AnnieFight4_Outro_130": "I don't want the last thing people remember about me being when I played a villain on your show.",
 "AnnieFight4_Outro_140": "Okay, not \"your\" show, but... you know... an episode of the show you work on. ",
 "AnnieFight4_Outro_150": "Nothing has ever stopped you from being a hero. ",

 "AnnieFight4_Outro_270": "The same stupid adults that make the same stupid mistakes over and over and over again. ",
 "AnnieFight4_Outro_280": "Is that what you're saying, Beowulf? ",

 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_0": "There you are, Aileen. What took you so long? ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_10": "Sorry, just had to go to the restroom. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_20": "Well, it's getting pretty late. I guess it's just about time we got you home. ",

 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_60": "It started out great. I was having so much fun.",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_70": "I got to see the set. We ate lunch, and then went to that hospital for those kids. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_80": "But then I saw how you treated Peacock and Beowulf. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_90": "I had to knock some sense into them.",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_100": "They had no business hunting the Skullgirl. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_110": "Maybe you're right. You needed to stop them before they got hurt.  ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_120": "But the Annie I know, that I idolize, wouldn't have done it the way you did. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_130": "Oh, and how would the Annie you know have done it? ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_140": "She would have encouraged Peacock to work hard to become a hero people can depend on. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_150": "She would have talked with Beowulf and made sure he wanted to hunt the Skullgirl for the right reasons. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_160": "She would have been kind and patient and understanding. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_170": "Instead you were cruel and blunt and bitter. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_180": "You acted more like a villain than a hero!",

 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_240": "Even if we could get to the car, there's no way we'll get out of the city.",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_250": "There's going to be panic and undead flooding the streets. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_260": "Crud...",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_270": "Okay. You two have to stick with me.",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_280": "I'll protect you, but we have to get to Medici Tower.",
 "AnnieFight5_Intermission_290": "Wait wait wait! We're running TOWARDS the Skullgirl?!",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_0": "Just what is that Skullgirl doing? ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_10": "My parents are going to be worried sick. Can't we–",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_20": "AAAHHH, it's a minion! And she has a worm in her head! ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_30": "Wait a minute, I know that minion and worm. Squigly? Leviathan? ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_40": "Oh my! Annie, is that you? ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_50": "My word, you haven't aged a day. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_60": "Never thought I'd run into you two again after what happened with Squigly's mother. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_70": "Let me guess, the maid causing the mess up there brought you back.",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_80": "She called out to the dead to rise up and to keep the tower from falling. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_90": "But why? If she let the tower fall and kill everyone below, that would only give her more minions. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_100": "Don't know, but I ain't about to question what's saving lives. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_110": "Big Band! You're looking a bit out of tune there, buddy. Did the Skullgirl do that to you?",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_120": "No, it was her. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_130": "RRRAAAWWWW!!!",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_140": "Painwheel. She's another ASG agent, but she's all tangled up in Brain Drain's puppet strings.",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_150": "She was ordered to attack the Skullgirl, even though that could make the tower fall. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_160": "And you tried to stop her. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_170": "Fighting other ASG agents isn't my usual jam, but I know how to improvise. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_180": "So we've got a Skullgirl saving lives and an ASG agent on a rampage. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_190": "I've got to admit, this is a first for me. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_200": "Still, our priority has to be stopping this Painwheel.  ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_210": "Big Band, Squigly, Leviathan, think you can back me up? ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_220": "You're going to have to do most of the fighting, but you can count me in. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_230": "Of course. Helping you with this is the least we can do. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_240": "It will be an honor to join you in battle once more. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_250": "All right. I'll try to keep Painwheel focused on me.",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_260": "You hang back and wait for opportunities to attack, but don't push yourselves. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_270": "Just do whatever you can and that will be enough. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_280": "Now let's go!",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_290": "Florence, what's going on? ",
 "AnnieFight5_Intro_300": "Just stay close. I promise it'll be okay. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_0": "That's one problem taken care of.",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_10": "I'll radio in some support from Lab 8. Hopefully they can keep her calm and help cut her strings.",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_20": "Now, what do we do about... ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_30": "What? Why are you looking at me like that, Aileen?",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_40": "Now this... this is the real Annie of the Stars!",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_50": "You swooped in and saved the day with friendship and strategy and swords and... and...",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_60": "It was so AMAZING! It's like I'm living in an episode. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_70": "What about me being \"a villain?\" ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_80": "I still don't like how you treated Beowulf and Peacock. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_90": "But I shouldn't have said the things I did. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_100": "I expected you to act like you do on TV.",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_110": "I wanted you to save the world and make it a better place along the way. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_120": "Maybe that's not always realistic, but you were able to do it just now. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_130": "That's because I know these two. I know I can trust them. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_140": "Don't you think, if you made friends with Beowulf and Peacock today, that someday they could have fought alongside you just like this? ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_160": "I guess...",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_170": "When I met these two fourteen years ago, they weren't much better. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_180": "Squigly was shambling around, trying to get used to being dead with a new parasite in her head.",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_190": "Big Band had never faced a Skullgirl before. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_200": "But with some help from a soldier and an old protege of mine, we beat that Skullgirl. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_210": "I think your heart has always been in the right place, Annie. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_220": "And when it matters most, you always pull through. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_230": "But in my opinion, your greatest strength has never been your sword. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_240": "Exactly!",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_250": "But all that stuff doesn't really–",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_260": "LORENZO MEDICI! ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_270": "Well, at least she didn't \"drop\" the tower.",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_280": "Looks like she's flying off towards the Grand Cathedral. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_290": "Then that's where we're going. We can't let her get away.",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_300": "We're right behind you. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_310": "What about me and Florence?",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_320": "There are still minions around and who knows when Medici goons will sweep in here to clean up. ",
 "AnnieFight5_Outro_330": "So stay close and try to keep out of sight.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_0": "I've heard some celebrities won't go anywhere without their entourage, but isn't this a bit much? ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_10": "Don't you know? There's safety in numbers!",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_20": "Well, you're in luck. I have just enough body bags to accommodate you all. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_30": "Annie, let me and Squigly deal with this.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_40": "You can go on ahead and make sure the Skullgirl doesn't get away.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_50": "Do you really think I'm going to let you do that? ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_60": "Not asking your permission. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_70": "Besides, I got some questions for you, Valentine. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_80": "We won't let this neophyte nurse stop you. Go! ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_90": "Okay. Just remember, all you have to do is keep her busy. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_100": "And Squigly, it was good seeing you again. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_110": "Of course. I only wish it had been under better circumstances. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_120": "Florence, Aileen, stay up here with them. If something happens, I want you to get out of here and find help. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_130": "Be careful, Annie. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_140": "Yeah, come back safe.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_150": "Don't worry, I've dealt with worse Skullgirls before.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_160": "Wait, you can't just–",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_170": "Sorry, Valentine, we're your next patients. I've got this itch to drum out no-good traitors.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_180": "Yes, we need immediate medical attention. This young woman has a serious cranial vulnus sclopetarium.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_190": "I can't even find my pulse!",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_200": "Hilarious...",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_205": "I have JUST the remedy for you hypochondriacs. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_210": "You are familiar to me, yet I do not know you. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_220": "I get that a lot from Skullgirls. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_230": "Yes, you are known to the Skull Heart.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_240": "You bear a curse that many would seek as a blessing. Yet while your youth is eternal, your life is not.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_250": "You willingly walk a path of hardship, and in this, I feel we share a kinship. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_260": "As you embraced your curse to defeat the Skull Heart, so have I embraced the Skull Heart to destroy the Medici. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_270": "Yeah, I don't need the whole speech about how we're not that different.",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_280": "There's only one thing you need to know about me: I'm the one who's about to bring you down. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Intro_290": "Then let us see if I will just be another corpse you leave in your wake. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_0": "I see the tattered soul behind that youthful visage. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_10": "You are worn thin by the world, and it is naive to your plight. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_20": "More than anyone, surely you have earned the right to have your heart's desire. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_30": "To grow, to live, to love, and to die as all mortals should. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_40": "All it would take is–",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_50": "Never going to happen. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_60": "I'll find a way to stop the cycle. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_70": "And when your power finally fades, so will my curse. ",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_80": "All right, Sagan, ready to deal with the real problem?",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_90": "[Whimper]",
 "AnnieFight6_Outro_100": "Don't worry. We got this, buddy. ",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_0": "Shapeshifter.",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_10": "Fitting for a demon to live in a... heck of your own making. ",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_20": "You are foolish enough to step into my domain. ",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_30": "And once more, you stand alone, with only your little Parasite to help you. ",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_40": "Sagan and I don't need anyone else.",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_50": "Yet you would not have arrived here so swiftly if not for the aid of allies. ",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_60": "An honorable officer of the law...",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_70": "..now clinging to life in a walking brass tomb. ",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_80": "A young girl...",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_90": "..struck down, raised from the dead, and then pushed by you to kill her own mother. ",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_100": "I wonder how much hesitation your blade will carry if \"they\" are your opponents?",
 "AnnieFight7_Intro_110": "Come over here and find out. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Intro_0": "Is that all you got, monster? I'm barely breaking a sweat here. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Intro_10": "Your descent into Gehenna has only begun.",
 "AnnieFight8_Intro_20": "For in this place, I am everywhere. I am everything. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Intro_30": "You have entered the maw of the beast, and this time, you shall not escape. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_0": "Hah... out of tricks already? ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_10": "There is plenty more to come. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_20": "Then bring it on. I don't care how many copies you make of yourself. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_30": "This time I'm bringing you down for good. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_40": "Then I'll find the source of the Skull Heart and put an end to this once and for all! ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_50": "You are truly burdened, child. Yet you were not always this way. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_60": "Once upon a time you had the most pleasant smile. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_70": "You found joy in nature and the twinkling stars of a pristine night sky. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_80": "Stop it. That won't work. It never works. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_90": "Your mother only wanted to protect that smile. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_100": "A wish that her daughter, her little star gazer, would never be sullied by the heartless world of adults. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_110": "It was one of the purest wishes I've ever heard, but even a wish for purity...",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_120": "... isn't pure. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_130": "Quit it. I'm not listening.",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_140": "I don't care what face you wear!",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_150": "You strived to save the \"adults\" from their ignorance and naïveté, like the unruly children they are. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_160": "But the cycle of the Skullgirl continues without pause. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_170": "The wish holds true. You have not been sullied by the \"adults\" of the world. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_180": "Your fall was of your own making. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_190": "The violence and the death in this world. You did not hide from it. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_200": "You bathed in it, and it has stained your soul. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_210": "You are jaded. You are cynical. You don't care about the world. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_230": "All you care about, all that drives you, is your desire to kill me. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_240": "In this, you have become worse than the adults you claim to loathe. ",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_250": "I am so disappointed to see what you've become, Annabella.",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_260": "Stop... STOP!",
 "AnnieFight8_Outro_270": "ACK!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_0": "D-darn you, monster. That was a cheap shot. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_10": "In service to the divine, no tactic is taboo. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_20": "And now no one, not even your Parasite, can save you. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_30": "Shall I give you a moment to utter a final prayer? ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_40": "Spare me your gloating and get it over with. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_50": "Then despair, Annie of the Stars, for you suffer your final defeat...",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_55": "...when you've never been closer to your true goal. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_60": "Annie!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_70": "What?!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_80": "Girls, stay behind us. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_90": "What are you doing here?",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_100": "We figured you beat the Skullgirl when Squigly collapsed.",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_110": "But when you didn't come back, Aileen made us come looking for you. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_120": "Luckily, this bandwagon arrived just in time. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_130": "Take cover, you two. Big Band and I will... we'll figure something out.",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_140": "You can't beat her. She'll kill you. Just leave me behind and–",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_150": "No!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_160": "We won't leave you to die. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_170": "You and Sagan came down here to fight the Skullgirl and this monster all by yourself. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_180": "You did it so the rest of us wouldn't get hurt. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_190": "But you don't have to fight alone!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_200": "We all want to help you, Annie. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_210": "Because you inspire us to be better. To do better. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_220": "To persevere against monsters like that!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_230": "So please, you have to get up!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_240": "Ggrrrrrraaar, raaarr!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_250": "This resistance is futile. Your hero has fallen.",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_260": "All you've assured is that you will share her demise.",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_270": "I won't... let you... ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_280": "...hurt them!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_290": "No!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_300": "This is the power I had forgotten. This is the power you cannot defeat. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_310": "The power of not a single star in the night sky but a twinkling galaxy. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_320": "The power of not a single soul but a legion who dare to dream of a better tomorrow. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_330": "Who dare to strive for a world without the Skullgirl. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_340": "I fight for those who cannot and inspire those who can. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_350": "This is who I am. This is who I must always be. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_360": "I am Annie of the People! ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_370": "I am Annie of the Stars!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_380": "YES! Go get her, Annie!",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_390": "Shapeshifter, centuries of hopes and dreams have sharpened my blade. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Intro_400": "Now my sword is the sword that will pierce the heavens and cleave your true heart!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_0": "You have... changed nothing...",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_10": "The cycle will continue. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_20": "[Rumble]",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_30": "Should have expected a star like you would bring the house down. ",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_40": "We better get this show on the road before it comes down on our heads.",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_50": "Just give me a second. I can finish this!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_60": "Annie, there's no time!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_70": "Aaaahhh!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_80": "They call to their hero, Annie. Will you save them...? Or will you sacrifice their lives to end mine?",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_90": "Grrrr... Sagan, we gotta get out of here.",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_100": "Rawr!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_110": "Aileen, hold on tight!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_120": "Okay!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_130": "Sagan, give me all you got buddy!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_140": "Gawr rawr VROOOOOMMM!",
 "AnnieFight9_Outro_150": "We're right behind you!",
 "AnnieOutro_0": "I just got off the phone with your parents. They're on their way to pick you up, Aileen.",
 "AnnieOutro_10": "They're not too mad, right? I don't want you two to get in trouble.",
 "AnnieOutro_20": "I assured them we spent the whole Skullgirl attack hunkered down here on the set. ",
 "AnnieOutro_30": "I've never had to lie to them about something like this before...",
 "AnnieOutro_40": "...but I promise I won't tell anyone what happened.",
 "AnnieOutro_50": "I don't think we have to worry about that. ",
 "AnnieOutro_60": "Annie, you should be resting!",
 "AnnieOutro_70": "It's all right. I can handle standing upright. ",
 "AnnieOutro_80": "Besides, I've got something to say.",
 "AnnieOutro_90": "Aileen, if you hadn't risked your life, I would have died back there. ",
 "AnnieOutro_100": "I'm sorry that I put you in a position like that, but I can't say how grateful I am. ",
 "AnnieOutro_110": "You not only saved my life, but you helped me remember what and who I fight for.",
 "AnnieOutro_120": "As you've probably guessed, I'm not your run-of-the-mill TV star.",
 "AnnieOutro_130": "[Giggle] Yeah, I might have picked up on a few hints. ",
 "AnnieOutro_140": "It's no secret the show is based on a lot of old legends and folklore. ",
 "AnnieOutro_150": "The truth is, a lot of those old stories are based on my life. I've been alive for centuries. ",
 "AnnieOutro_160": "Centuries!? That's amazing! How... how has no one figured it out? ",
 "AnnieOutro_170": "Well, it was a lot easier when I was just a radio star. ",
 "AnnieOutro_180": "The Canopy Kingdom was ruled with an iron fist back then. There were so many laws restricting the arts, everyone was smothered. ",
 "AnnieOutro_190": "People needed joy in their lives and a moral compass that didn't come from the totalitarian Renoir or the conniving Medici. ",
 "AnnieOutro_200": "So I decided to try and do some good while waiting for the next Skullgirl. ",
 "AnnieOutro_210": "I had to dance around every regulation and record in secret, but I got an episode of a radio show broadcast on the Canopy Radio Network. ",
 "AnnieOutro_220": "That one show became two, then ten, then a hundred. \"Annie: Girl of the Stars\" was born. ",
 "AnnieOutro_230": "Then, once TV got popular, the Renoirs greenlit an adaptation called \"Annie of the Stars.\" ",
 "AnnieOutro_240": "The only trouble: the director was ordered to bring in the radio voice of Annie for the project. ",
 "AnnieOutro_250": "Imagine how surprised he was when he found me.",
 "AnnieOutro_260": "I might have an idea what it felt like!",
 "AnnieOutro_270": "Luckily, instead of revealing my secret to the world, we worked out an agreement. ",
 "AnnieOutro_280": "I'd be the star of the show as long as I wanted, and the show would cycle crew regularly. That way, no one would be able to realize the truth. ",
 "AnnieOutro_290": "On top of that, we selected a life-double. While I was usually the star on screen, the other girl pretended to be the \"actress.\"",
 "AnnieOutro_350": "And Florence was the first one!",
 "AnnieOutro_360": "That's right. It taught me so much about the TV industry that I was able to become a successful producer.",
 "AnnieOutro_370": "Once the director was ready to retire, I came back to help keep Annie's secret. ",
 "AnnieOutro_380": "We had a good run. Just a shame it might all be over.",
 "AnnieOutro_390": "What do you mean?",
 "AnnieOutro_400": "Well, I let my bad attitude affect my work. Now the ratings are in the toilet. ",
 "AnnieOutro_410": "Hard to know how long it will be before we get cancelled.",
 "AnnieOutro_420": "About that.",
 "AnnieOutro_430": "Some news reports snapped pictures of \"Annie of the Stars\" helping to evacuate citizens downtown. ",
 "AnnieOutro_440": "It's been amazing press. The ratings on the rerun last night shot through the roof. ",
 "AnnieOutro_450": "And the buzz around the midseason finale with Robo-Fortune is staggering!",
 "AnnieOutro_460": "At the very least, I think we've bought ourselves a bit more time.",
 "AnnieOutro_470": "But that doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. ",
 "AnnieOutro_480": "I promise I'll get us out of this ratings slump. ",
 "AnnieOutro_490": "When I'm done, Annie of the Stars will be more popular than ever. ",
 "AnnieOutro_500": "In that case, I think it's time I brought up another piece of business. ",
 "AnnieOutro_510": "Annie, take a good look at Aileen. ",
 "AnnieOutro_520": "I don't know if you've noticed, but the right height, the right eye color, the right face structure...",
 "AnnieOutro_530": "Hmmm...",
 "AnnieOutro_540": "Florence, you sneaky little snake.",
 "AnnieOutro_550": "Well, you weren't going to do it. ",
 "AnnieOutro_560": "What? What are we talking about?",
 "AnnieOutro_570": "The current Annie actress retired a few months ago, even though her name is still in the credits. ",
 "AnnieOutro_580": "Usually, it's Annie's job to pick a replacement, but she was putting it off.",
 "AnnieOutro_590": "So, with the show's and Annie's best interests at heart, I took some initiative.",
 "AnnieOutro_600": "I decided to use an essay contest to try and find a suitable candidate.",
 "AnnieOutro_610": "Essay contest...",
 "AnnieOutro_620": "[Gasp]",
 "AnnieOutro_630": "Job's yours if you want it, Aileen. I think you've more than proven yourself.",
 "AnnieOutro_640": "EEEEEEEEE!!!",
 "AnnieOutro_650": "Uh, I mean... ahem. It would be my honor. ",
 "AnnieOutro_660": "But, can I make some requests?",
 "AnnieOutro_670": "Sure, let's hear them.",
 "AnnieOutro_680": "I want you to apologize to everyone from yesterday. ",
 "AnnieOutro_690": "And I want you to let Peacock guest star on the show at least once.",
 "AnnieOutro_700": "Yeah, we can make that happen. ",
 "AnnieOutro_710": "Then yes! Yes yes yes yes yes! ",
 "AnnieOutro_730": "Heh. Better be careful, Annie, this one will keep you honest.",
 "AnnieOutro_740": "[Gasp]",
 "AnnieOutro_750": "What? Whatcha looking at? I got something in my teeth? ",

 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_10": "Cool, right? Wrong! It’s super annoying!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_20": "You’d think being a princess means I get to be in charge!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_25": "But instead, EVERYONE ELSE bosses ME around over every little thing I do!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_30": "And the bossiest of them all is my big sister, Parasoul!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_35": "She’s the coolest big sister there is, ",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_37": "but she’s also a big jerk who never lets me have any fun.",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_40": "She’s been working hard every day since Mom died to make our kingdom a better place, ",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_45": "beating up bad guys and kicking butt in the name of justice!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_50": "Isn't that awesome? So why doesn't she let me come with her?! ",

 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_70": "[concerned noises]",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_80": "Well, it's not ALL bad. There’s at least one cool thing about being a princess.",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_90": "I get an umbrella that talks! Why don't you introduce yourself, Hungern?",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_100": "[HORRIBLE HUNGERN NOISES ]",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_110": "Great job, Hungern! He says he’s pleased to eat you!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_120": "Er, I'm sure he meant to say he’s pleased to MEET you.",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_130": "Everyone says Hungern is a horrifying weapon of unfathomable power,",

 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_140": "[AGREEABLE HORRIBLE HUNGERN NOISES]",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_150": "That’s right! We’re unbeatable AND adorable. We can kick bad guy butt just as hard as Parasoul can!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_155": "Together, we could even beat up the Skullgirl!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_160": "Not to brag, but guess what? That's EXACTLY WHAT WE DID!",
 "Umbrella_DrawnIntro_170": "It all started when Parasoul decided to take us to the boardwalk...",
 "Umbrella_Intro_0": "I don't know why you insisted on wearing your raincoat on a clear day. Do you really want to spend our one afternoon together at the boardwalk in that stuffy outfit?",
 "Umbrella_Intro_10": "Obviously? This is way cooler than that tacky princess stuff.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_20": "Besides, if I wore something fancy, Hungern would just drool all over it anyway. Then you'd get super duper big sister mad at me!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_30": "Hungern is your responsibility. That means making sure it doesn't drool, doesn't cause a scene, and doesn't eat anything - or anyone - it isn't supposed to.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_40": "Rude! Hungern would never eat people! Would you, Hungern?",
 "Umbrella_Intro_50": "[Agreeable Hungern noise]",
 "Umbrella_Intro_60": "See, look at how much he agrees! He's even drooling!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_70": "*sigh* Every day I wonder if bestowing you with Hungern was truly the right decision.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_80": "Come ON. How am I supposed to have fun without my best friend?",
 "Umbrella_Intro_90": "Hungern is not a toy or a pet. I gave it to you for your own protection. So if you insist on feeding it, at least limit Hungern’s diet to proper food only!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_100": "Borrrrring. Why’d you give me a living weapon if I'm not allowed to fight?",
 "Umbrella_Intro_110": "Believe me, if there was any other way to make sure... ",
 "Umbrella_Intro_115": "Nevermind. For now, Hungern is ONLY to be used for self-defense.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_120": "I TOLD you he wouldn't eat people, but fine. He’s happy eating garbage anyway.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_130": "Feeding it garbage for entertainment is not an acceptable use of a family heirloom!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_140": "Come ON! Why not?! Hungern LOVES garbage.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_150": "Garbage is NOT food!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_160": "It’s food for some things! Like raccoons. And Hungern.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_170": "Absolutely not. Its breath smells bad enough already.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_180": "Roger that, Princess Commander-In-Chief of the NO-FUN Police.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_190": "That is NOT my rank! Besides, we're having fun right now.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_200": "We’re at the boardwalk. There are games, ice cream, and rides. We're surrounded by fun!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_210": "But we're still arguing like we always do.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_220": "We could go on a ride! That’s fun! Although come to think of it, they don’t look very safe.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_230": "Maybe we could play a game instead? Throwing balls up a slope or firing a cork gun at stuffed animals seems to be considered \"fun\" by the people here.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_240": "Sis, you're great at beating up bad guys and keeping the kingdom safe but you suck at having fun.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_245": "I wish you'd taken us to jail instead. I wanted to see that cool gigan lady from TV!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_250": "We haven't had sister time for far too long. We should spend it doing something fun and wholesome together, not gawking at society's miscreants.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_260": "But I want sister time where you’re doing COOL stuff!!! Fighting bad guys and saving the kingdom!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_270": "That work is serious, dangerous, and– wait, someone’s calling.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_280": "What is it? I told you not to interrupt today! I'm with Umbrella and we're having fun.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_290": "What?! The Skullgirl? In New Meridian? Now?! Ready the Egrets, I'm on my way.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_300": "I GET TO SEE YOU FIGHT THE SKULLGIRL!?!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_310": "This is now the best day of my LIFE. I'll be so good!!! Best behavior! Hungern too!",
 "Umbrella_Intro_320": "Absolutely not! It’s much too dangerous. I'm arranging to have you evacuated back to Canopolis immediately.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_330": "WHAT?! Boooooooooo! This is now the WORST day of my life.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_340": "We didn't even get ice cream.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_350": "I... okay, Umbrella, listen to me. If you are very good, do not go ANYWHERE ELSE, and wait right there at the ice cream stand for the Egrets to pick you up, you can have as much as you want.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_360": "Hungern wants ice cream too. A lot of it.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_370": "Just this once, Hungern can have all he can eat.",

 "Umbrella_Intro_400": "Yeah. Crystal.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_410": "I'm on my way.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_420": "Sure was a lot of talk about sister time for someone who doesn't spend any time with her sister.",
 "Umbrella_Intro_430": "[concerned noises]",
 "Umbrella_Intro_440": "SIGHHHHHHHHHHHHH it’s FINE. Let’s see what flavors they have. I'd love some SALTED caramel.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_0": "Oof!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_10": "[Growl]",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_20": "Hungern STOP! No chompies!!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_30": "Sorry, he NEVER bites! He does bark a lot, but he doesn't try to bite people most of the time. I mean, he bites AT people, but he's not trying to EAT them or anything.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_35": "There was one time he tried to eat a cat, though, but he wasn't that serious about it because I mean if he had oh boy that cat’d be–",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_40": "Um, can I help you, little girl? Are you lost?",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_50": "No! I can find my way around just fine. We're getting ice cream!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_60": "Ice cream, eh? That’d hit the spot right now. We never did finish that milkshake.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_70": "We don't have time for treats, Samson! We have to find Carol and the Skullgirl.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_80": "Uh, who are you talking t–WHOA THERE’S A MONSTER IN YOUR HEAD.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_90": "Samson, this is why I told you to keep quiet!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_100": "That’s SO COOL!!! How did that happen? Where’s your brain? Is doing your hair hard?",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_110": "You're full of questions, aren't you? Well, I don't remember, I don't even want to think about it, and yes.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_120": "Cool! Seems like it’d be fun!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_130": "It isn't as fun as it looks.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_140": "Trust me, kid, the alternative would have been worse.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_150": "If Hungern lived in my head, I'd be able to eat ten gallons of ice cream in one bite! That'd be worth having weird hair.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_160": "Wait, did she just say HUNGERN?! As in Hungern, insatiable devourer of people, armies, civilizations, and everything in-between?",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_170": "Uh, you must have him confused with someone else. Hungern’s my best friend and a big sweetie!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_180": "My big sister says he doesn't think or have feelings, but he talks to me! Mostly about how he’s hungry.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_190": "You just better not be a bad guy, because he eats evildoers for breakfast.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_193": "And lunch!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_195": "And also dinner.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_200": "Change of plans, Filia. We're gonna have to be the bad guys this time.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_210": "What?! Samson, no! I'm not going to fight a little girl!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_220": "Trust me, Hungern is more dangerous than you can imagine. I don't know how she got hold of it, but we gotta stop it NOW, before it eats that kid and half of New Meridian!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_230": "He doesn't look that dangerous, just gross, but if even you think it's that serious...",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_240": "Sorry little girl, I'll be taking that umbrella!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_250": "Wait, you wanna fight for real? COOL! Let’s go! The two of us vs the two of you!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Intro_260": "We'll show Sis we can handle ourselves just fine!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_0": "YAY!!! We actually DID IT!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_10": "I knew the whole time there was no chance they could beat us and I wasn't scared even a little bit!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_20": "What IS that thing?! How can anything be that powerful? Or that GROSS?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_30": "Yeah, no kidding. I've never met a monster like this one.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_40": "You said you knew all about that living weapon!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_50": "Not the umbrella, the kid! Hungern eats life energy so fast she should be dead just being close to him this long. If she's still standing, she’s more of a freak than he is!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_60": "I hope the two of you learned your lesson. You can't attack random people for no reason.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_65": "Even if it is really fun.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_70": "Are you sure you're really okay? Samson says that weapon you have is dangerous, to you and everyone around you.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_80": "He’s not dangerous! Well, at least not to me. And you two aren't hurt too bad, are you?",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_90": "No, which is another surprise. Short stuff over here sure has Hungern well trained.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_100": "What Samson meant to say is he’s very sorry and he won't do anything bad ever again.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_110": "Yay! We saved the day! Wait until Parasoul hears about this!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_120": "Parasoul? That name sounds familiar... isn't she some kind of royalty?",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_130": "Wow uhhhHHHmmm how about we drop that subject and pick up some ice cream instead! My sister’s paying.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_140": "[HUNGRY HUNGRY HUNGERN NOISES]",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_150": "That’s a lot of slobber. He might not be dangerous, but he’s pretty gross.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_160": "HEY, don't be mean! Hungern isn't gross. He’s the cutest!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_170": "Cute? Him? Ha, you sound like Carol when she talked about my dog. He was super gross, but she loved him so much...",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_180": "Wait, Dog? What dog? Ugh–",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_190": "Easy kid, don't force it.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_200": "Carol was so important to me and she’s in big trouble. I wish I could remember more! Maybe then I'd be able to find her.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_210": "What does she look like? Does she look cool and have a weird monster in her head like you? Maybe we can keep our eyes out for her!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_220": "When I ran into her earlier, it was like she being was controlled by someone else. They hooked spinning blades to her spine and turned her into some kind of... nightmarish weapon.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_230": "Wow, so she looks even cooler than you do.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_240": "That's one way to put it. Still, if you do see her, let her know I'm looking for her. Just... be careful. She isn't herself these days.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_250": "It was nice fighting you too! I promise I'll help your friend if I ever see her!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_260": "They were nice, weren't they?",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_270": "[Screams]",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_280": "You still want ice cream? Let’s get some!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_290": "SORRY! \nSOLD OUT! \nCOME BACK TOMORROW!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_300": "WHAT?! How did they sell out already?",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_310": "Can't fight the Skullgirl on an empty stomach. Eat up, fellas!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_320": "HEY, no fair! Your goons cut in line, and you can't hog all the ice cream! That one doesn't even have a mouth!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_330": "Lenny, it’s okay, don't listen to her.",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_335": "Aw geez, he’s crying now, look what you did!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_340": "I'm gonna give you a piece of my mind!",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_350": "Wait, you look familiar... almost like some kinda princess...",
 "Umbrella_Fight1_Outro_360": "Uhhhhhhh NOT ME! No princesses here! Well, gotta go! ENJOY YOUR ICE CREAM! BYE!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_0": "[confused/concerned noises]",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_10": "Stop complaining, we aren’t lost! We're just... taking the scenic route.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_20": "Besides, it's the city's fault. I bet we would have caught up to my big sis already if all these buildings weren't in the way.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_30": "Hey, that’s it! If we climb them, finding Parasoul should be easy! I'm so smart. If we hurry, we'll probably get there in time to see her fight the Skullgirl.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_40": "I've climbed plenty of trees, so a skyscraper is no sweat. Just think about it like a really tall tree made of metal and rocks.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_50": "See, Hungern! This is... easy...",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_60": "Though... these buildings are... really tall. My hands are getting tired. ",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_70": "W-whoa! ",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_80": "Don't worry! I gotcha!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_90": "WHEEE! ",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_100": "There we go, kiddo, safe and sound. You know, climbing buildings is pretty dangerous! Why don't you leave the acrobatics to the professionals?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_110": "Wow, you're strong! WOW, cool outfit! WOOOOW, cool hat!!! Are you part of the circus?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_120": "You got it! If you promise to be a good girl and not climb buildings, I'll give you a free ticket to see me do my stuff under the big top.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_130": "REALLY?! OKAY! I promise! I've always wanted to see the circus, but my sister won't let me!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_140": "She says it’s run by the Medici Mafia and they're super bad! They kidnap people, beat up anyone who crosses them, and organize crimes. That’s worse than regular crime!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_150": "Maybe your sister’s been watching a little too much TV. The news loves stories about the big scary Medici, but in real life they're nothing like that.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_160": "Really? I thought organizing crime was bad.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_170": "The Medicis might have a scary reputation, but they aren't bad guys. Take Vitale, for instance. All he organizes is the circus! Is that a big crime?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_175": "Just don’t ask how we got the elephants.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_180": "I guess any crime involving elephants is a big crime, but that doesn't sound like a very bad one.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_190": "See, you get it. A circus makes everyone's life more fun. It’s win-win! A way better deal than anything that snobby royal family ever gave us.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_200": "They love to make a big show of keeping the peace, but who’s actually out in the streets helping people? Not their fancy Egrets, that’s for sure.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_210": "Cerebella, are you done playing with that child? Need I remind you we have a Life Gem to procure?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_220": "Ergh. No, Eliza.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_230": "Then what are you– Wait? HUNGERN?! What is she doing with a Renoir weapon?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_240": "Heyyyyy it's been great talking to you and I'm glad Hungern is getting the recognition he deserves but... we really should be going!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_250": "What are you talking about? She’s just a little kid.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_260": "Oh my dear Cerebella, don't you recognize a member of that royal family you so despise? This girl must be Princess Umbrella Renoir! She’s worth ALMOST as much as Lorenzo's precious Life Gem.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_270": "Little girl, how would you like to see the circus... right now?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_280": "Um, no thank you! You're extremely scary!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_290": "Oh, what a pity. Cerebella, why don't you and I show our darling princess some traditional Medici hospitality?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_300": "B-but, she’s just a kid! She didn't have anything to do with...",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_310": "Is that so? So you don't think her family should pay for the war that destroyed your home country?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_320": "Sorry, I can't remember. Was it Franz's war or Nancy's rampage that left you orphaned and begging for scraps? It’s so hard to keep track of Renoir atrocities!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_330": "Wait... they did WHAT?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_340": "But you're right, the Renoir children are surely innocent. \nRemind me, how many of your friends did Parasoul and her Egrets arrest in her last raid?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_350": "She hasn't done anything... yet. Her family is the one who should pay.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_360": "And with the daughter of royalty as our bargaining chip, we can make them pay quite handsomely!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_370": "Think of all the good you could do with just a small portion of what the Renoirs keep for themselves. We don't have to hurt a hair on her head.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_380": "Sorry kiddo. This isn’t about you.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_390": "I knew I could count on you, darling.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_400": "I thought you were nice, but you're just another bad guy!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Intro_410": "W-well I'm not scared of you! Me and Hungern won't lose!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_0": "W-we did it! We beat up the bad guys... right?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_10": "Impossible! How could I lose... to a child?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_20": "I'll show you how serious I can be. I'm sure your family will pay just as handsomely for you if you're missing a limb or two!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_30": "Oh, give it a rest.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_40": "You knocked her out?! Please, you’re not really a bad guy, are you Cerebella?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_50": "I can't believe I'm hearing this from the daughter of that tyrant and his genocidal monster of a wife... ugh! What a joke.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_60": "Whatever, there's no point in yelling at a kid. Even you don’t deserve whatever Eliza has planned for you. Get out of here before she wakes up or I change my mind.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_70": "Wait! What was that scary lady saying before? Did Mom and Dad really do those things? Aren't we the good guys?",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_80": "You're a kid, you wouldn’t understand even if I told you. Go on, run!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_90": "STOP CALLING ME A KID! Geez, you’re as bad as my sister. Whenever I ask ANYONE to tell me about ANYTHING they call me a kid and change the subject.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_100": "I mean, you’re at least honest, even if you hate my family!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_110": "Even the Renoir's own kid is sick of the lies, huh? Fine. I warned you!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_120": "So your parents meant to do good, huh? Too bad that's not what they DID.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_130": "Maybe your dad didn’t MEAN to start a war and your mom might not have MEANT to turn into the Skullgirl and kill everyone and turn them into zombies, but they still did it anyway!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_140": "B-but Dad was just trying to stop the fighting!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_150": "He wanted to stop the fighting? He started the war in the first place and then sabatoged the peace talks!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_160": "Some good guy. He was nothing but a greedy tyrant!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_170": "B-but M-Mom wished to end the war! That was the whole point, a pure wish to make it all better!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_180": "Maybe the Queen really did feel bad about the war Franz started, but she made it a hundred times worse! It only ended after a bloodbath that cost thousands of lives and ruined countless more!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_190": "Maybe that's what it took to stop that tyrant, but if you ask me, there’s no way she could have made a selfless wish. Your mom turned into the worst Skullgirl anyone can remember.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_200": "Everything good they did for you and your kingdom came at a price, and it was people like me and my family who paid it.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_210": "You’re lying! Stop it! Th-they wouldn’t ever do that!",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_220": "You’re the one who wanted to hear it, remember? Tch, I knew this was a waste of time. I don’t feel any better at all.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_230": "Just bitter.",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_240": "Ugh...",
 "Umbrella_Fight2_Outro_250": "She’s waking up. Get out of here. I’m serious this time!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_0": "We got away from the scary skeleton lady at least, but now we’re really lost.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_10": "[sympathy]",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_20": "I know. I’m hungry too, but more than hungry, I’m mad!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_30": "I can’t believe someone who’s so nice and strong would work for someone so bad!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_40": "It’s all mixed up. S-she was talking like WE’RE the bad guys!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_50": "Parasoul says bad people are just selfish and greedy, but I wonder if sometimes they do bad stuff because they think they're the good guys.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_60": "I thought you’d have to be pretty dumb to mix up good and bad, but it sounds like Mom and Dad and Parasoul did it all the time!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_70": "Why didn’t they just do good things in the first place instead of doing bad things and expecting good things to happen? That doesn’t make any SENSE!!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_80": "Good guys are supposed to do good things and beat up bad guys. Why don’t grown-ups get something SO OBVIOUS?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_90": "*sigh*... I don't know if I even want to find Parasoul or even go home anymore.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_100": "[hungry gurgle]",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_110": "We can find food somewhere else! Maybe we can eat garbage.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_120": "Hey there, little lady! What are you doing all by your lonesome out here? You lost?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_130": "You should go home. It’s dangerous. You never know where the Skullgirl will show up next. Do you need help finding your mom?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_140": "My mom died after becoming the Skullgirl, so I don’t really need any help finding her or anything. Pretty sure I know where she is.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_150": "Uh, oh wow... I’m really sorry kid. What about your Dad, where’s he at?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_160": "If you didn’t like hearing about what happened to my mom, you’re not going to like the answer to that question any better.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_170": "W-well what about your– Wait, I’m not making the same mistake again. Any way you slice it, a kid like you shouldn’t be out here all alone!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_180": "Look mister, I’m trying to have an existential crisis here, and it’s really hard when you won't leave me alone. Why do you care, anyway?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_190": "Why? Because I’m Beowulf! Wrestling star, friend to all children and enemy of evil! I’m on a comeback streak to take New Meridian by storm!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_200": "Beo... who?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_210": "You know, Beowulf! Everyone knows Beowulf!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_220": "Are you supposed to be famous or something?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_230": "Come on, it's me, wrestling star Beowulf! The hero who slew Grendel and his mother too! On live TV!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_240": "I’ve never seen you on TV, and I watch a lot of TV.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_250": "Kids these days... this is why my comeback is more important than ever! This generation needs inspiration!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_260": "[hungry gurgles]",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_270": "HOLY SMOKES, what sort of freakish beast is that?! Don’t worry, I’ll save you!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_280": "Um... that’s not what’s happening? That’s not even close to what’s happening. Hungern's just–",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_290": "I can see the headlines now. \"Beowulf Saves Little Girl From Monster.\" I'm back, baby!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_300": "He's just hungry and... you know, I don’t feel like trying to correct you anymore.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Intro_310": "You asked for it, mister. Hope you like it EXTRA SALTY!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_0": "Sorry I tried to save you from that very uhhhhhh... cute pet you got there. It’s a real handful! Er... or is it a mouthful?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_10": "Thanks mister Be A Wolf, or whoever you are! I feel a little bit better after beating you up.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_20": "Like I said, the name's Beowulf. B-E-O-W-U-L-F. But I’m glad I could help!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_30": "As long as you learned your lesson. Don’t you know how trying to help just makes things worse?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_40": "Hey now, that’s too pessimistic for a kid to say. Sounds like you need a bit of the Beowulf magic to cheer you up!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_50": "You’ve got even less of a chance of saving me from bummers than you do from Hungern. Unless you know a magical way of going back in time to stop my parents from being big idiots who caused problems on purpose.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_60": "Hey, you’re a grown up, aren’t you? You’re like super old and retired?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_70": "The Wulf never tires and will never retire! I’m on my way to a comeback!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_80": "Oh cool, so that’s a yes. Why do good people do bad things? You’re a grown-up, so you know the answer, right?",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_90": "Uhhhmmm. I don't really know the answer to big questions like that, but I’ll tell you what I do know!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_100": "You can’t change the past, no matter how much you want to. The only thing you can do is look to the future, with a burning passion in your heart, and do the best you can with what you’ve learned!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_110": "Even if what’s done is done, there’s a future out there counting on us. You can do right by your folks by not making their same mistakes.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_120": "Wow...that actually makes sense. It was almost kind of inspiring. You should be on TV!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_130": "I can’t stress this enough, but I literally WAS on TV!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_140": "Maybe that’s why Parasoul doesn’t think fighting bad guys is fun, because Dad did it all the time and it turned out really bad.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_150": "If she just trusted me, she wouldn’t have to worry about me, and I could take care of myself. I’m great at beating up random strangers!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_160": "And what if Parasoul starts acting like Mom and Dad and ends up doing something terrible because she wants to protect me? I can't let that happen.",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_170": "Thanks mister Big Old Wolf, but I gotta go! Hope you get to be famous someday!",
 "Umbrella_Fight3_Outro_180": "Like I said, I’m ALREADY FAMOUS!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_0": "[Grumble]",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_10": "Hungern, SHHHH. I know you’re hungry, but if the Egrets hear you they’ll just drag us home and we won’t get to talk to Parasoul!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_20": "We NEED to talk to her. I’m mad about the lying and her going off to fight the Skullgirl without me, but this is even more important!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_30": "Parasoul's always trying to do everything all by herself. Just like Mom when she tried to stop Dad. That's why they ended up fighting each other instead of working together!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_40": "Am I going to have to fight her the same way someday? No way! We can't let that happen. I'm gonna convince her we need to take on the Skullgirl together this time.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_50": "Oh, look, there she is!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_60": "You’re positive the Skullgirl is around here? How did we lose her?! What’s wrong with the Theonite detectors?",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_70": "And you STILL haven’t found Umbrella?! This is a disaster.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_80": "If I had known having \"fun\" would be so difficult, I would have practiced having it sooner.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_85": "Perhaps then she wouldn’t have run off...",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_90": "Forgive us, Princess. We’re still searching, but–",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_100": "HEY SIS, DID YOU FIND THE SKULLGIRL YET?",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_110": "UMBRELLA?! How did you get here?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_120": "Well I... uhhh... got lost!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_130": "The Skullgirl just destroyed Medici Tower! You need to get to safety immediately!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_140": "Wait, listen! I wanna help this time!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_150": "I knew I shouldn’t have left you alone. This is all my fault.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_160": "I’m not going to make the same mistake again. Adam, escort Umbrella home. Take a regiment with you!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_170": "Hey, I’m not leaving! Hellllooo, can anyone hear me?",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_180": "Princess, I know you’re worried, but we don't have anyone we can spare.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_190": "I don’t care what it takes to keep her safe! This family has lost enough.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_200": "LISTEN. TO. ME!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_210": "[ROARS]",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_220": "...",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_230": "U-Umbrella, what’s wrong? Your eyes–",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_240": "Nothing’s wrong with me and I’m NOT going ANYWHERE! I’m not going to let you get rid of me!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_250": "T-this isn’t a game, Umbrella! You could get hurt!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_260": "YOU could get hurt, dummy! Did you ever think about that! Huh?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_270": "You keep telling me I have to stay home, but Hungern and me are super strong! We can beat up any bad guys! I bet we’re stronger than YOU!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_280": "Where did this power come from? This shouldn't even be possible. Hungern should be suppressing it!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_290": "Listen to me, Umbrella. You can't fight like this, that power isn’t safe!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_300": "Yeah? Then make me!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_310": "Forgive me, Umbrella. I don’t care how much you hate me as long as you’re safe. I'll protect you, even from yourself.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Intro_320": "I don't NEED your protection and I'll PROVE IT!!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_0": "When did Umbrella become so powerful?! This shouldn’t be possible!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_10": "Is there nothing I can do to save her from Mother's curse?",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_20": "See, we can take care of ourselves just fine! If we’re stronger than you, you don’t need to protect us.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_30": "Please, Umbrella. You have to understand how dangerous the Skull Heart is. That power of yours is the exact reason you can't go anywhere near it!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_40": "You’re just trying to get rid of me! Why won’t you let me help? If I’m not there to protect you, you’ll do something stupid, just like Mom and Dad did.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_50": "W-what do you know about what Mother and Father did? They made... difficult choices and didn’t put their feelings before their duty to the kingdom.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_60": "But that's not the whole story, you LIAR! Apparently everyone but me knows that Dad did a bunch of war crimes and Mom was the worst Skullgirl ever!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_70": "No, that's... that's not true. Yes, they made mistakes, but it's not that simple.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_80": "It seems pretty simple to me! Dad started a war to protect the kingdom, but wars don't protect anyone!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_90": "Then Mom sacrificed herself to protect us from the war, and Dad sacrificed himself to protect us from HER!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_100": "In the end, no one protected anybody!! They did the entire opposite of that, and now it's just you and me!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_110": "Damn it Umbrella, we don’t have time for this!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_120": "When’s it gonna be time, then?! Is it gonna be after you get yourself killed and leave me all alone just like Mom and Dad did?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_130": "N-no, I would never... I would never leave you!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_140": "Liar! If you won't protect yourself and you won't let me help, what am I supposed to do? Just sit in the castle while you risk your life until you lose it?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_150": "If that's how it's going to be, then I wish we weren't sisters. I'd be fine on my own and you'd never have to worry about me again!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_160": "Umbrella, wait!",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_170": "I knew this day was going to come. Why did it have to be today, of all days?",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_180": "Princess, we can find the Skullgirl. The Egrets will understand if you need to talk to her yourself.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_190": "No. Thank you Adam, but I can’t be selfish and put my feelings before the Kingdom.",
 "Umbrella_Fight4_Outro_200": "I’m not sure I deserve a second chance to talk to her anyway.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_0": "I was so mean... Sis is never going to want to see me again!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_5": "Wahhhhhh!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_10": "[licks affectionately]",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_20": "Ewwwww HUNGERN! Stop licking my face! That tickles! ",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_30": "Thanks, you always know how to make me feel better.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_40": "I just wanted to help her! I wanted her to understand she didn’t have to keep doing everything alone.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_50": "I thought I was helping, but I just made everything ten times worse.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_60": "I guess our family’s just super good at that. Maybe it’s hopeless.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_70": "Hey, what's that noise? Is someone there?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_80": "Keep searching. A massive Theonite surge was detected within a three block radius of this point. The Skullgirl MUST be here.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_90": "And yet... there are high Theonite readings near The Grand Cathedral. A curious contradiction.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_100": "Will... continue search... but... what am I doing here?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_110": "Focus, Painwheel. You’re especially resistant today. That encounter with the schoolgirl and her follicle parasite has you distracted.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_120": "Hey, uh, are y–",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_125": "AH! NEVERMIND SCARY LADY MADE OF SPIKES!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_130": "The Skullgirl! No, it’s just a kid...",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_140": "You’re not... who I’m looking for.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_150": "Uhh, you’re looking at me kind of weird. Who are you mumbling to? Aren’t you a little old to have an imaginary friend?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_160": "My orders are to look for the Skullgirl.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_170": "No... wait... I’m looking for a friend. My best friend. Her name is Filia–",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_180": "Oh, I met her earlier today! You must be who she was trying to find!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_190": "Wait, that girl! What are these readings?! This signature matches the Skullgirl’s!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_200": "I will interrogate the subject personally.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_205": "YOU, CHILD. Who are you?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_210": "AAAAAA!!! YOUR IMAGINARY FRIEND IS REAL?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_220": "I see, you're the youngest Renoir. That means your mother... aha. You were exposed during fetal development. Fascinating.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_230": "You have something in common with this girl, Painwheel. Though it's the result of more... natural processes, she has Skullgirl blood, just like you.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_240": "Hey, that’s MY brain! Get out of it!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_250": "An opportunity like this couldn’t be more perfect. Bring her back for analysis.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_260": "No! I won’t fight her... I'm not going to let you... make her... like me!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_280": "I'm afraid you don't get a choice in the matter. I am exerting direct control this time. \nINITIATE PROTOCOL ZERO.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_290": "ErrrrrrGHHHARRRRRRRRR!!! H-help... please... he's controlling me. Stop me, please! You can't let him get you, too.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Intro_300": "Your imaginary friend is a big bully! Sorry if this hurts, but we won't let him boss you around any more!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_0": "GAAAHHHHHHRHRRRRRR!!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_10": "Why are you still resisting direct control?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_20": "Come on angry lady! Don’t let that shadowy jerk control you!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_30": "W-what is this interference? Resonance between their Skullgirl blood?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_40": "It’s breaking the link! PAINWHEEL! OBEY!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_50": "RAAARRRRRRGHHGHHGHH!!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_60": "My. name. IS. CAROL!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_70": "GaAaHHHhhh––––!!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_80": "*groan* ...ow.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_90": "Are you okay angry lady? That scream was super loud.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_100": "I... think so. At least Brain Drain isn’t in my head anymore.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_110": "You’re really scary but the nice lady with the mean hair said you were a good person, so I believed in you.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_120": "Who? Filia? She really said that?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_130": "Yeah, she was super worried about you!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_140": "Oh, and my name’s Umbrella. Are you okay?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_150": "Like the princess? My name’s Carol... but you probably knew that from how loud I yelled it before.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_160": "Your friend there hits pretty hard, but it's nothing compared to what it felt like having Brain Drain stomping around in my head.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_170": "Oh no, sorry about Hungern. He doesn’t know how to hold back. But he’s really nice when you get to know him!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_180": "Do you want to sit down? I’m really tired too. I had a big fight with my sister because I can't control my unfathomable dark power.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_190": "O-oh? I’m sorry, that sounds terrible.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_200": "The unfathombable dark power is pretty cool, I guess, but fighting with my sister sucks.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_205": "She’s super good at kicking butt and doing the right thing, but we never seem to agree about ANYTHING.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_210": "It sounds like you care about her a lot, even if you fight.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_220": "I do! Except I was a big jerk to her and caused her tons of problems and ran away.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_225": "I don’t think she’s ever going to want to see me again.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_230": "I wanted her to listen to me so I yelled and screamed exactly what I thought as loud as I could!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_235": "Which didn’t work for some reason.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_240": "It might sound odd coming from me, but yelling and screaming doesn’t usually help solve problems.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_250": "Ugh. I know, I just didn't know what else to do!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_260": "Fights like that are hard, but I think even after a big fight, if she really loves you, she’ll forgive you.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_270": "I guess that's true. Even though my big sis is a big jerk sometimes, we make up in the end. Eventually.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_275": "After we have another big fight about it.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_280": "That sounds a lot like my parents.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_285": "They're really strict and overprotective, but I know it's out of love, even when it's a bit too much.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_290": "I wish I could go see them, but... I don't know if I can ever go back to them while I look like this.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_300": "Of course you can! Yeah, you look like a freaky porcupine helicopter death machine, but it’s not your fault!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_310": "Plus, they’ve got a daughter that can FLY now. If they don’t think that’s the coolest thing ever, they’re stupid.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_320": "Yeah... maybe. I hope you’re right.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_330": "Umbrella! There you are! You have to come with me right now, we need to get out of here.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_340": "Why, what happened? Where's Parasoul?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_350": "The Skullgirl completely overwhelmed our forces. Some kind of shapeshifting monster took us by surprise and separated us from Parasoul.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_360": "She told us to evacuate the city while she held off the Skullgirl. Please, you have to come NOW! She can't hold the Skullgirl off forever!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_370": "No! This is exactly what I SAID was going to happen!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_380": "Sorry Adam, I can't go with you. I need to save Parasoul!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_390": "Umbrella, you can't! She warned us that the Skull Heart is especially dangerous to you. I know this is hard, but don't let her sacrifice be in vain.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_400": "I don't want her to make a sacrifice at ALL!!! I'm not going to let her end up the same way Mom and Dad did. Do you really want Parasoul to die?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_410": "Of course I don't! I know all too well what happened to the King and Queen. I never want Parasoul to experience anything like that ever again.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_420": "Then what are you waiting for?! If being around the Skull Heart is so dangerous, I trust Parasoul to save me, just like I'm gonna save her!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_430": "It might be risky, it might be dangerous, and she might yell at me again, but at least we have a chance to both be alive by the end! So I'm going no matter what!",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_440": "There's nothing I can do to change your mind, is there?",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_445": "If I can't stop you, then the Black Egrets are going with you. Let's save Parasoul together.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_450": "Wait, let me come too! I was made to fight the Skullgirl.",
 "Umbrella_Fight5_Outro_460": "Yay, more friends!!! See, everything will work out if we believe in ourselves or whatever! Let's go!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_0": "Come in, Egrets! Molly! Adam! Roxie?! Panzerfaust?! Is anyone there?",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_10": "Double has already suppressed them.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_20": "I can defeat you all on my own, Skullgirl. I’ve been training for this day for seven years!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_30": "I thought you would have appreciated an end to the Medici rot infesting this city.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_40": "And you expect me to believe it'll end there? There is only one fate for a Skullgirl, no matter how noble you might think yourself. I know that all too well.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_50": "Your mother’s fate still weighs on you, I see. Too much for us to see eye to eye.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_60": "What do you know about her?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_70": "Only that she fought against fate for as long as she could.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_80": "And that she left behind a daughter that will share her same end.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_90": "No, she will not! I took precautions to make sure that would never happen!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_100": "Then you have underestimated the power of the Skull Heart. I can feel her power growing, and the Skull Heart calling for her in turn.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_110": "Queen Nancy would pale in comparison to the Skullgirl created if your sister were to wish on the heart.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_120": "You'll never lay a finger on Umbrella! I’ll destroy you and the Skull Heart both before that happens.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_130": "After every memory of the Medici has been wiped from this world, you may kill me as you wish.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_140": "Until then, I will fight you with all my power!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_150": "Egrets, attack!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_160": "What?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_170": "Where did they come from?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_180": "Umbrella?! NO! You can’t be here!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_190": "I totally can! Watch me! Look at how here I am right now!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_200": "Umbrella, listen–",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_210": "No, we’re not doing this again, YOU have to listen NOW!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_220": "Take care of your sister. We’ll handle the Skullgirl!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_230": "Egrets, charge!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_240": "N-no, I can still fight!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_250": "Look at how bad you’re hurt! Of course you can’t fight!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_260": "This is nothing! If I don’t fight, who will keep you safe?",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_270": "If you sacrifice yourself I won’t have any family left! How are we going to have family time if you’re dead?",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_275": "You said you'd never leave me! Did you think about that, DUMMY?!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_280": "N-no! Umbrella... I... of course I won't leave you alone. I'm sorry that... I almost did.",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_290": "You’re super cool sis, but you can’t be cool if you’re dead. Who’s going to protect me if that happens?",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_300": "You need someone to protect you too! That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’ve got Hungern!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_310": "AAAHHH!!!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_320": "Look out, we can’t hold her back!",
 "Umbrella_Fight6_Intro_330": "Don’t worry! This time, we’ll protect each other! Come on, sis!",

 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_30": "I'll admit the thought of a rematch does have me excited. She's gotten so feisty since our first encounter. Maybe this Skullgirl will finally prove as exciting as the one who gave me my smile!",

 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_50": "Go get ‘em, ma’am! This is a rocket pack we swiped from the Egrets. It only goes one way, so one little mistake and BAM! Your guts’ll be splattered all over what’s left of Medici Tower!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_60": "I wouldn't have it any other way. Take me to the edge!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_70": "Oh dear, is that all? I was hoping for an evening of thrills. What a disappointment.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_75": "You MONSTER!!! I'll make you pay!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_80": "Ah, now that’s more like it! Thank goodness this won't be boring. Our last encounter was quite anticlimactic.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_90": "There were people underneath that tower! I was protecting them and now... now they're all dead, because of you!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_100": "Oh ho ho! Don't tell me you stopped yourself from throwing the tower at Lorenzo so you could protect all those innocent people?",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_110": "You missed your chance to kill him and now they're all dead anyway. Why, how simply hilarious!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Intro_120": "How dare you treat people’s lives like cheap toys! I'll stop the Medicis and their heartless killers no matter what it takes!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_0": "Is that all? What a letdown. They simply don't make Skullgirls like they used to.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_10": "P... atric... ia...",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_20": "What a delightful expression you make in the depths of despair! Maybe you aren't so boring after all.",

 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_40": "Really? Let’s test that. Let me look into your eyes and see if your resolve is strong enough to defy death and become something more!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_50": "Oh well, I suppose not. Maybe you should have wished harder.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_70": "Speak of the devil. No offense, but you didn't do a very good job of granting her wish, did you?\nShe should have asked for a refund.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_80": "My power is real. Anything you desire is possible, with sufficient imagination... and sufficient purity.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_90": "What do you desire, Dahlia?",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_100": "Let me think... AH! I've got it! How about to not see you again for seven years?",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_110": "Now now, don't trouble yourself, I can grant that wish myself. Die, or whatever it is you do.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_120": "Do not be so hasty. Is there truly nothing you desire? You live for the thrill of combat. I can make you young again, restore your broken body, and grant you immortality.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_130": "Truly? You can make me young and whole again? ",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_140": "All is possible through my power.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_150": "Boring. I've already died once, and I'm closer every day to dying again. What part of me could you fix that won't only be destroyed again in the end?",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_160": "An old woman like me knows better than anyone that nothing lasts forever. That's what keeps it all interesting!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_170": "Strange. You, who has lost so much, only desire to gamble away what little you still cling to?",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_180": "I don't expect you'd understand. You'd have to have something to lose, and then lose it all, to understand how thrilling the experience can be.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_190": "If what you desire is not power, money, or youth, why not spare me until you find what it is you truly want? I can grant the wishes of even the most twisted heart.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_200": "The Skull Heart is begging ME for its life? Oh ho ho! Fine, maybe you can entertain me a little longer.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_210": "After all, you're what everyone but me wants. Perfect for baiting a trap that greedy little kitten Ms. Fortune won't be able to resist.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_220": "*Snap* Oh girls~",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_230": "You called, Ma’am?",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_240": "Buttercup, Bonnie, Killer– Secure the Skull Heart and take it back to the club.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_250": "The rest of you, come with me. We're going to send out some invitations and whisper in a few choice ears. I want the whole city to know where to find the Skull Heart.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_260": "But Ma'am, if we do that, just about every thug, cutthroat, parasite-ridden freak, and murderer in the city is gonna come heading straight for us!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_270": "...and?",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_280": "You're a genius, mistress Dahlia!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_290": "It’s just too fantastic! Oh it’s going to be so much fun!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_300": "There’s gonna be SO many people to murder!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_310": "So true, my darling little rabbits! At least I can count on all of you to not bore me.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_320": "Perhaps you girls aren't as empty of desire. Do you not idolize her? You are in awe of her strength and respect her brutality. One wish, and everything she has can be yours.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_330": "What? Why would we want what Ms. Dahlia has? WE’RE what Ms. Dahlia has!",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_340": "Giving Ms. Dahlia everything she wants, fighting and dying every day for Ms. Dahlia... what else could a girl dream for?",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_350": "*sigh* Oh Ms. Dahlia...",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_360": "Even her followers have no desire? They have barely more individuality than the Skullgirl’s minions.",
 "Dahlia_Fight1_Outro_370": "How rare to see humans with such purity of purpose.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_0": "I'm back, girls! It’s been too long since I had a night out on the town. Be a dear and clean the blood off this cape, will you?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_10": "Yes Ma’am!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_20": "Sowing mayhem is almost as fun as reaping it. It won't be long before Ms. Fortune falls into our lap.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_30": "I hope you weren't too bored. Did you have fun tempting my bunnies?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_40": "Hardly. I thought you had been foolish to trust them, but I see you had no need to fear.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_50": "They are so empty of desire they hardly seem human. What did you do to them?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_60": "Why, nothing at all, usually! This world makes an endless supply of girls like them with or without my help.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_70": "The rest of the Medicis are all too happy to find a use for the broken unfortunates who end up at their door, but they prefer tools with enough left upstairs to manipulate.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_80": "I, on the other hand, only want the ones who lost everything and still want to live... but don't care if they die.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_90": "Turning them from broken dolls into adorable assassins is a little hobby of mine. It worked out so well in my case, I can't help but want to share the experience.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_100": "So this is all you desire? To share the nihilistic thrill of combat on the edge of life and death?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_110": "It’s so good to meet someone who understands! So few do but my precious bunnies.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_120": "Ma’am! Someone’s here for the Skull Heart! She looks like an undead minion, but she’s pretty strong and she’s really, really mad!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_130": "Y... you! Black Dahlia!!! I won’t, I can't, I'll never ever forgive you!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_140": "My Lady, you must compose yourself! Without the Skullgirl, we cannot sustain ourselves much longer. Even to defeat this wretched fiend, the cost is too high! We fight for a greater purpose than revenge.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_150": "I know that, Leviathan! I know that, but... but...",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_160": "This monster killed Mom and Dad! She's the worst person who could possibly have the Skull Heart. We have to stop her now before she becomes another Skullgirl!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_170": "Please, Leviathan, I know it's hard but we have to keep fighting! I can't go back to sleep before we stop her!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_180": "You're not the ones I want, but I'm quite happy to play with you if you're bored, whoever you are.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_190": "How dare you?! Is that all you have to say, murderer?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_200": "Should I know you?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_210": "You killed me!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_220": "I kill a lot of people.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_230": "I believe this is Sienna “Squigly” Contiello, Ma’am. You killed her and the rest of the Contiello family 14 years ago.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_240": "Oh, Selene's Birthday Party! I remember now.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_250": "I'll never forget the most lovely face your mother made when she saw your brains splattered all over her birthday cake.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_260": "You murderous, malicious, matron of misery! I swear on my honor as a friend and heirloom of the Contiello’s, you will pay for what you have done!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_270": "You are beyond redemption! We won’t let the Skull Heart fall into your hands!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Intro_280": "Oh, I can't wait to see your face twisted in agony! How will you compare to your dearly departed mother?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_0": "My, you've become someone quite interesting since I last killed you. You almost put up a good fight!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_10": "No! I can't lose now! You made me a corpse, but I'll never let you hurt anyone again!",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_20": "Power AND purpose? I've given you so many gifts! But those stubborn fixations of yours have made you weak.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_30": "Try again in seven years. If I'm still around, I'll let you have another go at me for being such a good sport.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_40": "Did this... entertain you?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_50": "It certainly didn't bore me.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_60": "But did it fill your heart with joy? How did it compare to the first time she suffered at your hand? I know this was not the challenge you sought. You came nowhere close to that brink you desire.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_70": "Ohoho, I do admire your persistence. What should I wish for, then?",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_80": "You are a mere bodyguard. Why not simply take control of the Medici yourself? Surely with power will come opportunities to find what you seek.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_90": "I can't imagine a bigger pain in my britches than running the Medici’s bureaucracy myself.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_100": "Think of my precious bunnies forced to give up their tommy guns for typewriters. I couldn't do that to them.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_110": "So you fear not defeat, but fading away, and losing the edge you crave. Yet the more powerful you become, the harder it is to reach. Your slide into boredom and obscurity will be inevitable, unless you correct it soon.",
 "Dahlia_Fight2_Outro_120": "You can't make me give up just yet. The night is still young, and the entertainment has barely begun!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_0": "Ma’am, sorry to interrupt, but Mr. Vitale Medici is here. He says he has something urgent to discuss.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_10": "Tell him I'm busy. As if Lorenzo’s nagging wasn't bad enough, humoring his witless son is even more of a bore.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_20": "Now now, Dahlia. I know you're a busy woman, but I promise I'll make it worth your while. Cerebella, bring her out.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_30": "Dahlia too?! Come ON, what did I do to deserve the starring role in this three-ring circus of whackjobs and killer clowns!?",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_40": "Shut your mouth, thief!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_50": "Well, well, well, look at what dragged in the cat!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_60": "I was the one who caught her, thank you very much. Don’t forget that, Vitale, or our deal.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_70": "Eliza, wonderful to see you. We missed you at the ballroom brawl last Thursday. It was a rather grisly one, I'm sure you would have enjoyed it.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_80": "I’ve been so busy with charity work recently that I haven't had the time to swing by. I do so love the entertainment you provide– but pleasure can come after business.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_90": "And what sort of business do you have for me? It seems you already have the prize in hand.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_100": "Isn't this the opportunity to curry dear daddy’s favor, Vitale? I'd thought you'd want to hand her over personally.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_110": "What if I wasn't satisfied with my father’s favor? What if I knew the real reason he’s so desperate to find this petty thief?",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_120": "Ah. I see you're not entirely stupid.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_130": "He's aged gracefully. So gracefully only a fool would think it was natural. ",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_140": "Can you understand what it's like, to become older than my own father, while he still doesn’t deem me fit to rule? I'll age into senility and death while still languishing under his shadow.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_150": "It's a tragedy to think of Vitale's wasted talent. I think he'll do a MUCH better job than that decrepit has-been. This city is due for a new leader that understands the nuances of power.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_160": "Why Eliza, I didn't know you had such a soft spot for Vitale. What did he offer you, exactly?",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_170": "I'm merely doing my civic duty, returning stolen goods. Vitale offering me a little trinket and control of the city’s blood banks was a generosity that took me COMPLETELY by surprise.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_180": "Oh, of course, my dear! That trinket he promised you wouldn't happen to be the Skull Heart, by any chance?",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_190": "I wouldn't have accepted, but he simply insisted on it! What a generous man Vitale is.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_200": "So you get the Skull Heart, Vitale gets the Life Gem, and Lorenzo gets a bullet. What do I get?",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_210": "Vitale and I have big plans– big enough to entertain even you. Far grander in scale–",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_220": "–than Lorenzo could ever dream? A generous proposal, but it’s ever so predictable. I could have recited your script word for word the moment you walked in the door.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_230": "Don't be stubborn, Dahlia. Name your price. I can match your wildest dreams. I know you have no true loyalty to my father.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_240": "Poor stupid Vitale. What a waste. If only Marcus had more flexibility in his moral compass. He might have come up with a proposal worth accepting.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_250": "Marcus?! I have accomplished FAR more than that cowardly–",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_260": "And you've lost twice as much as you’ve gained. Smart leaders play the long game, and you don't have any room for the big picture in that inflated head of yours.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_270": "Anyways, if the Medici’s power is secure, what’s left for me? New Meridian is a fun playground because we have to fight for it every day. I can't imagine how boring it would be with you lording over this city.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_280": "You're twisted. You actually LIKE all this carnage. If Vitale was in charge, the whole city would be better off! We'd have peace. This isn't about fun!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_290": "I trained you well in combat, but you're still so naive. That’s how Vitale likes them, I suppose.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_300": "It’ll be entertaining to see your face when you realize the truth. Or perhaps you'll surprise me? Being defeated by my own student would be an amusing way to go.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_310": "How adorable, are you actually picking a fight with us? You've lived for a long time playing smart, Dahlia. Don't be stupid.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_320": "I thought you'd understand me better than that, Eliza! You always struck me as an ambitious sort, but here you are, slinking around with the lesser of two evils. Disappointing!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_330": "Perhaps I should show you how I earned the name of The Crimson Scourge!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Intro_340": "Please do. I've always wanted a chance to paint the town red with you!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_0": "Give it up, you wretched has-been.  As long as there's blood to drink, I am immortal!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_10": "I'm positively brimming with youth compared to you, Eliza. I’ve known for a while your beauty regimen is delightfully unconventional.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_20": "Ha! You knew my power and still thought you could beat me? I'll just take a sip and– what?! Why isn't my blood returning to me?!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_30": "All down the drain! I won't bore you with the details of the plumbing, but this stage cleans the blood away in a jiffy!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_40": "This isn't enough to kill me, Dahlia! I haven't survived for ages to die at the hands of a child like you!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_50": "I'd have been disappointed if it was that easy!  In the course of my long career, I've had to get creative when disposing of my more entertaining enemies. When all else fails, there’s one standby that almost always works.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_60": "Girls, see how hot she likes it, will you?",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_80": "I see she likes it around 2100 degrees Fahrenheit. Oh Eliza, how feisty! Nothing less would do for you, would it?",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_90": "Ever since we first met I've always wondered what expression you'd make in your last moments. Ah, the face of a dying immortal is everything I'd dreamed it would be!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_100": "Dahlia, be reasonable, I can give you a better deal. You can keep the Skull Heart! You can have the troupe, Vice-Versa, Cerebella! Do whatever you want with them! But just listen–",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_110": "No. Please take a good last look, Cerebella, at the real face of this man.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_120": "NO! VITALE!!!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_140": "Ah, that felt wonderful! I've been waiting to do that for ages.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_160": "Ma’am... bad news! Ms. Fortune is gone! And she stole the Skull Heart, too!",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_170": "Oh my dear Cerebella, I couldn't even trust you to keep your quarry restrained. You need a thorough re-education it seems.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_180": "Go lock her up for a bit. We can let her stew while we re-acquaint ourselves with that little thief.",
 "Dahlia_Fight3_Outro_190": "Perhaps I underestimated that feral. I wonder, is it pure luck? Or is that feisty little kitten more interesting than I gave her credit for?",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_0": "If you destroy me, there will be no way to see your precious family ever again.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_10": "Shut up! A buncha corpses ain't family. I don't need you. The whole world will be better off if I smash you to dust!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_20": "Now now, we can't have you breaking my new toy.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_30": "Dahlia?! Dammit, I thought I had a bigger lead. I'll take care of you after I smash this stupid thing for good!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_40": "I'm afraid I can't let you do that, kitten. It’s keeping me entertained, so I’d prefer the both of you back in one piece. ",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_50": "Yeah right! I remember exactly how many pieces you left me in last time. Don't try me. I wish you were dead and I'd love to be the one to make it happen!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_60": "That can be arran–",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_70": "–but I DON'T wish that on you, so don't get any ideas!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_80": "You know running won't do you any good, Ms. Fortune. Remember what happened the first time you tried?",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_90": "Yeah? Chopping me up and throwing me in the river didn't work out so great for you either, now did it? You can't keep this cat in the bag.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_100": "I'm so glad you mentioned dismemberment! Since that was so unsuccessful last time, I've been spending my late hours thinking of some entertaining alternatives I might use on you!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_110": "Ha ha ha... ha. Me and my big mouth.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_120": "But I'm not going down without a fight!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Intro_130": "Music to my ears. It would have been so boring if I didn't get to take you back personally.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_0": "This is positively fascinating! No matter how much I smash you to pieces and cut you to ribbons, you bounce right back, good as new!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_10": "I should find fighting you terribly frustrating, but for some reason, I just can't get enough!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_20": "Damn it, don't toy with me!  I don't care how long it takes, I'll make you pay for what you did to my family!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_30": "Oh? You want to make me pay that badly? Why wait? You have the solution to all of your problems right in your hands!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_40": "The Skull Heart? Ha, you WANT me to make a wish on this thing? You're one crazy old lady!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_50": "Go ahead! It just might make you a bit more interesting than you are now. Two Skullgirls in one day would be quite thrilling!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_60": "I...",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_70": "I'll do anything to stop you. But I won't do that.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_80": "Even if you beat me, even if you kill me for real... \n",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_90": " I'm not letting you or anyone else have this stupid skeleton factory!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_100": "Oh?! Not on my watch!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_110": "Insipid mortal! I could have granted your every desire! Your family would have lived again if you had only wished upon me.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_120": "Damn it! Shut up! You can't even decide which body part you want to look like, don't try to make me decide how to use you!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_130": "I can't stop missing my family, but I can't undo the past, either.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_135": "The good and the bad made me who I am today. That's how the Fishbone Gang raised me! To challenge the future head-on!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_140": "I have new friends to protect and like hell I'm gonna risk them for a wish on some moldy cursed skull.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_150": "This is unacceptable! Has every mortal lost their mind?!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_160": "Poor little thing, it just isn't your day.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_170": "So, Ms. Fortune, despite suffering the agony of dismemberment and the brutal heartache of losing your loved ones, you still cling to your morals.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_180": "Oh darling. Ohhhh darling! I rather like this attitude of yours.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_190": "I wonder how long it can last? How many times can I kill you before you give in, and reveal how boring you really are? Can you do it without your precious immortality? Can you stay interesting all the way to the very end?!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_200": "Sorry lady, I've got places to be. I'm not gonna be the sideshow in your freaky death circus!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_210": "Dumb luck isn't going to save you this time, darling.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_220": "Are you sure? I'm pretty lucky! We've been here a while and everyone in New Meridian is looking for the Skull Heart.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_230": "Oh ho ho ho ho ho, oh goodness! Are you truly betting some dimwitted hero or thug is going to swoop out of the sky and accidentally save you just by sheer coincidence? I haven't had a laugh like this in ages!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_240": "Ha. I guess it is kinda funny, but what if it actually happened? You’d feel pretty dumb, wouldn't y–",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_250": "BEEP BOOP. Skull Heart energy detected. Capturing suspected Skull Heart bearer.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_270": "What!? SERIOUSLY? I was joking!!! Wait, why do you look like me?!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_280": "Target 1 and Target 2 acquired. Executing high-velocity departure protocols. ",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_290": "Oh no you don't! No one is that lucky while I'm around!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_310": "Target 1 lost. ERROR. Launch sequence cannot be canceled. Lift off commencing!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_320": "...  ha... Ahahaha...",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_330": "OH HO HO HO HO HO HO HO!!! ONE MILLION DEATHS WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR YOU MS. FORTUNE!!!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_340": "I can't believe her blind luck! Back to square one yet again!",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_350": "Eheheheheheh, what is this feeling? Lost again to nothing more than a freak coincidence, \nbut I can't stop... smiling.",
 "Dahlia_Fight4_Outro_360": "I haven't felt excitement like this in much too long!",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_0": "We've been had, girls. Until Ms. Fortune starts living up to her name, we've got our work cut out for us.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_10": "I'm positively furious! Scour the city for any leads on who or what could have made such a thing!",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_20": "On it, Ma’am!",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_30": "Ms. Dahlia’s in such a good mood now! I wonder what happened?",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_40": "Ottomo, can I get your eyes on something?",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_50": "Yes, Ma’am!",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_60": "I managed to blow this chunk off the thing that snatched Ms. Fortune away. Take it apart and see if you can't find out who built it.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_70": "Right-o. I'll have this junk sorted out in a jiffy!",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_80": "You are truly enjoying yourself.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_90": "Of course I am! It’s been a long time since my dance card was so full. And the best is yet to come.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_100": "I suppose to something like you, a seven year blip is nothing. For me, the limbo between thrills is nothing short of agony itself.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_110": "I am well-acquainted with the desperation of mortals. In fact, one could say it is inextricable from my very existence.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_120": "Yet even after ages upon ages, I have fallen short of finding a mortal whose desires are yet sufficient to complete my purpose. Such time weighs upon even a timeless existence such as myself.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_130": "Ah, a kindred spirit! I never expected to have so much in common with a heart so heartless.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_140": "We're both dependent on humans to either surprise or disappoint us. We are wholly apart from their lives, yet without them we have nothing.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_150": "You speak as if you aren't one yourself.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_160": "Do you think of me as human? I believe I crossed the line some time ago, both physically and otherwise.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_170": "You are fascinated by others but have no desire to make a wish for yourself. What a fascinating form of selflessness; a demon not unlike a saint.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_180": "A saint would give you the same problem, wouldn't they? Someone with a truly pure heart would never make a wish on you.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_190": "Ha! You are more clever than most who make wishes. But such a paradox defines my existence.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_200": "Funny I should have a reason to remember Selene Contiello today. She was as pure and gentle a soul as one can find in this world, but in the moment she wished on you, I saw a woman so desperate to cling to the family and life she knew that she was willing to gamble it all.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_210": "I would so love to see a face like that again. It would be the closest thing to seeing what my own face looked like the moment before a previous Skullgirl of yours made it into my permanent smile.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_220": "This is why you are drawn to Ms. Fortune. For all she’s been through, for all she’s endured, she has not changed. She did not make a wish.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_230": "When I fell over the brink myself, I realized there was nothing in this world that mattered but seeing that moment again.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_240": "Ms. Fortune is still clinging to the edge, but she just hasn't been pushed far enough. Eventually she'll see the true face of this world, and when she does... ",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_250": "...she'll make the same face I have.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_260": "Yet suppose she remains true?",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_270": "You think it's possible? You’re surprisingly optimistic about human nature.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_280": "The possibility remains. You would not bet if the outcome was certain. In fact, you long to be proven wrong, do you not? For reasons even you do not understand.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_290": "Reading my mind again?",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_300": "Only your heart.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_310": "Oh ho ho ho ho! Well, if it turns out that Ms. Fortune exceeds both our expectations, I will make a wish on you.",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_320": "Amusing. But you have no wish, do you not?",
 "Dahlia_Intermission_330": "You never know. Perhaps I'll think of something that surprises us both.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_0": "Sorry to interrupt Ma’am, but the guest list is filling up and they all want a piece of the Skull Heart!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_10": "I suppose this will have to do for entertainment while Ottomo finds us a lead on Ms. Fortune. Bookie, please introduce our guests.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_20": "Roger, ma’am! First up is Valentine! She’s a nurse! She's a ninja! She’s an ASG agent as deadly as she is thematically inconsistent!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_30": "If it isn't the infamous Black Dahlia. I heard one of the old ASG models fell in with the Medici, but that was decades ago. Still kicking I see... but not for long.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_40": "Interesting! Let’s see if the labs have come up with something that can compete with an old model like me.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_60": "HEY! Listen up, idiots, do you actually want to live past tonight? Then stop squabbling and pay attention because-",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_70": "Another one? Goodness, she’s noisy.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_80": "This girl mostly matches the description of Marcus’s daughter, a schoolgirl named Filia. Something’s off about her though... probably the parasite infecting her hair and brain.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_90": "For the last time, it’s F-U-K-U-A! Man, I told that hourglass-waisted chick this was a waste of time. No one ever listens until it’s too late!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_100": "Yes yes, we've heard it before. She’s a real underdog, but don't underestimate her! Now I don't know how this last one got in through the door, but this is the detective Big Band, a smooth cyborg with a heart of gold!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_110": "Oh, I remember this one. Officer Birdland, how have you been since your early retirement?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_120": "Now there’s a tune I haven't heard in a while. Wouldn't mind if I never heard it again, but fate has a funny way of reprising itself when you least want to hear it.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_130": "Still on the same beat. Don't you ever tire of it? A thankless job, and they keep churning out new models to replace us. Why not give my side a try?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_140": "No thanks, Dahlia. I don't think the two of us will ever jive on our definition of fun. I like the beat I'm on just fine.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_150": "Poor Ben. You still don't understand, even after all these years. Like the rest of those naive ASG agents who thought defeating the Skullgirl would make them a hero. ",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_160": "Nearly dying cured me of that naivete and replaced it with something far more fulfilling, as it should have for you.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_170": "I always wondered if you had a hand in my \"early\" retirement. No room for a good cop in a city dirty with Medici money. Still, I didn't end up anything like you.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_180": "Then you're a fool, and you'll be one until you die for the last time. Still caught up in romantic fantasies about good and evil, when the only thing that matters is the life or death edge of combat!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_190": "I deluded myself into thinking there was any sort of difference between the two, until the Skullgirl ripped my body apart and taught me my true self!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_200": "That Skullgirl was free! She didn't couch her pleasure in the self-justification of the wicked or righteous. She just took what she wanted, living on the edge of life and death.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_210": "That's the truth of this world! The only difference is who buckles underneath it, and who has the strength to overcome this world with their will!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_220": "Nice monologue. Can't say I care about any of all that though. No offense, but I know where I stand.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_230": "Sounds to me like you're the one who isn't quite sure. I don't need a reason to do the right thing. But if you don't see those faces twisted in fear, doubt sets in, don't it?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_240": "Maybe you start to think you're just another two-bit goon with delusions of grandeur and not the true face of evil. ",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_250": "Interesting deduction, detective.  Why don't I test that resolve of yours?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_260": "We'll see if that hypothesis proves true.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_270": "LISTEN TO ME! Damn it, you all love to hear yourselves talk, but when the end of the world comes you won't be–",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_280": "Goodness, sweetie, how you go on. I'm beyond bored. This is going to take forever.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_290": "All right, it’s your lucky day. I'll fight all three of you at once. Maybe then you'll actually stand a chance at entertaining me!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_300": "All too happy to bring you into retirement! Geriatric care isn't my specialty, but I'm something of a generalist. The rest of you better keep up!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_310": "I've got a bigger bone to pick with you than her, Valentine, but I'll let it slide until after we've cleaned this up.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_320": "WAIT!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Intro_330": "Enough! I have time for fighting, not squabbling!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_0": "Damn. I always hoped it would end with a crescendo, not a dirge.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_10": "Poor Ben, you really should have retired when you had the chance.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_20": "Call me sentimental, but no matter how old I get, I never get tired of fighting for what’s right.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_30": "I certainly haven't tired of fighting, but I no longer have that insufferable attitude you do. I don't know how you've held onto it this long.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_40": "Now here I thought your favorite thing was watching what people do when they're just about to fall off the edge.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_50": "It’s a given some of them will turn out like me instead of like you.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_60": "You can't fool me! You're afraid. Won't it be bitter to die not knowing what will happen next?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_70": "You never know when the show’s over. Woke up thinkin’ it might be today anyway.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_80": "You've got whatever you've got. Me, I've got a little bit of hope.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_90": "...",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_100": "He’s boring me. Get him out of my sight.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_110": "Ma’am?! Are you sure?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_120": "I'll let you postpone your date with destiny, Ben. I don't want you to die before I wipe that expression off your face.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_130": "And clean up the rest of these while you're at it!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_140": "One day he'll get it... everyone will get it. I'll make them understand...",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_150": "Boss, sorry to interrupt, but I've analyzed the parts from that machine you fought earlier. It seems to have been made by some chap in the ASG labs.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_160": "Really? How did you find that out?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_170": "I dare say, someone's properly chuffed about their work. Many pieces have “LABZERO HVY IND” etched into them.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_180": "“Lab Zero”? There is no Lab Zero.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_190": "Ma’am, that ninja nurse's radio is ringing!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_200": "She was an ASG agent, wasn't she? Well, now's the perfect chance to see if they've got a certain feral kitten in their hands. Give it here.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_210": "...they've changed the model since the last time I used one of these things.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_220": "Why wouldn't that be the right button?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_230": "Um, ma’am? I think the green button is the–",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_240": "You take care of it. I haven't the time to fuss with it.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_250": "Of course, Ma’am! Live in 3, 2, 1...",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_260": "Valentine?! Where are you? You were supposed to rendezvous with Robo-Fortune a half hour ago.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_270": "I’m sorry, the nurse is currently unavailable. If you’d like what’s left of her, I can arrange for her to be delivered in one of her own body bags.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_280": "Who is this? How did you get this frequency?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_290": "Have I been so easily forgotten? I was once the pride and joy of the ASG.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_300": "Ah... now I understand. Valentine failed. I presume this is Black Dahlia?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_310": "Oh good, I'm glad we don't have to waste time with introductions. You know who I am, and I don't care who you are. You have something that belongs to me, and I have something you want.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_320": "I have a feral with an extremely high tolerance for damage I previously used as the template for one of my less reliable minions. If you want her more than the Skull Heart, we have a deal.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_330": "One of my girls will provide you the coordinates. Be here in one hour.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_340": "This is perfect, Ma'am! You'll have a chance to get back Ms. Fortune, kill whoever kidnapped her, and keep the Skull Heart too. It’ll be a perfect double cross!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_350": "Wait, what if he already knows we're going to kill him? Maybe it’s just what he wants and we're heading right into a trap!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_360": "Come on, don't be stupid. Obviously he knows we know and knows we know he knows, so he'll let his guard down assuming that we know he knows we know he knows!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_370": "Oh, I get it!!! Wait, no I don't. Ms. Dahlia, what’s the real plan?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_380": "Girls, this is why I always tell you to keep things simple. Why waste effort trying to divine if this is a trap when there's a much easier answer.",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_390": "What’s that, ma’am?",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_400": "We'll just kill him the second we get what we want no matter what he does!",
 "Dahlia_Fight5_Outro_410": "Oh Ms. Dahlia, you're a genius!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_0": "Right on time. I was somewhat hoping I might see Dr. Geiger again. After all, one of his own former agents is about to deliver the Skull Heart to ASG labs on a silver platter. Unless the good doctor is no more?",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_10": "Dr. Geiger’s status is of no concern to those who are no longer active agents, Dahlia. You gave up your past a long time ago, and quite gladly, as I recall.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_20": "Here I was hoping we could have a friendly chat.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_30": "Do you have the Skull Heart?",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_40": "Do you have Ms. Fortune?",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_50": "Robo-Fortune, if you would.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_60": "Presenting TRADE OFFER.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_70": "I really didn't want to do this twice in one day. I didn't even want to do it once!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_80": "I confess to some degree of suspicion as to why you believe this exchange is worthwhile. An alley cat for a wish-granting device is a trade so generous you'll forgive me for not assuming you do not intend to kill me immediately afterward.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_90": "Perish the thought! The Medici reputation is at stake.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_100": "The Medici reputation is what I'm worried about. I cannot make an exchange without knowing the full terms of the deal. It's not an intelligent decision, you understand.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_110": "Is it really so strange that I'd want an exceptionally interesting plaything? A man of your intelligence should be able to guess what motivates me.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_120": "I am more familiar than you know with the illogical desires that motivate you. So familiar, in fact, that there must be something exceptional about this specimen for you to go to these lengths for her.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_130": "Her combat ability is surprising when cornered but otherwise mediocre. I have, in fact, been observing this one for a while.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_140": "Valentine recommended her as a blueprint to test an upcoming project of mine, but creating a robot duplicate to surpass her was a trivial challenge. I fail to see what purpose the original now serves.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_150": "What the Medici want, the Medici get. That is all the logic you need to understand, darling.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_160": "So this is Medici business? I knew the interest was not simply personal. Lorenzo's bodyguard is willing to trade an artifact he has coveted for years for a two-bit thief. Even if you are not motivated by sound decision making, he is.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_170": "Then why don't you tell me what's so special about her? But make it snappy. Lorenzo would do more than kill to get her back, so I wouldn't make him wait much longer.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_180": "I assume that it has something to do with her inability to die. A very rare trait. One so rare that I can think of only one other individual in New Meridian who shares it.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_185": "Someone who has avoided assassination an implausible number of times while remaining in the prime of his life for a suspicious number of decades.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_190": "Oh dear, and I've spent years making sure there isn't enough evidence left behind for anyone to discover the truth about Lorenzo.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_200": "Be glad there are few intelligences of my caliber in this city. I have more than a passing interest in life extension, for reasons I will not elaborate on.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_210": "So Ms. Fortune stole it. That explains what, but not how. She has nothing of value on her person. Unless... that's it!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_220": "Robo-Fortune! Run trash compactor sequence.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_230": "Engaging.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_240": "What!?! Hey! Stop!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_250": "Ah, a Life Gem! Of course, but how did she manage to assimilate it into her flesh? This certainly merits further research...",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_260": "You killed her.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_270": "Apologies for depriving you of the pleasure. It was simply more efficient.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_280": "I'm afraid that this alters the terms of our deal. A pity, this could have been solved with a little honesty earlier.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_290": "...",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_300": "This is not the outcome I expected. Ms. Fortune has no chance of exceeding our expectations now.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_310": "......you.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_320": "YouUUU FOOOOOOL!!! ",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_330": "W-what?!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_340": "I WAS GOING TO KILL HER! I WAS GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO SAW HER FACE AS SHE SUFFERED!!!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_350": "Boring, boring, boring... it’s all so boring!!!  You impertinent brain in a jar, you can't imagine what you've deprived me of! A short sighted fool like you could never understand!!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_360": "I won't even enjoy this, but I'm going to have to take my time. So you...",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_370": "Can properly.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_380": "Understand.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_390": "WHAT YOU'VE STOLEN FROM ME!!!!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_400": "Now that’s the Black Dahlia I remember. I assumed a battle to the death would be unavoidable.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Intro_410": "Luckily, I have come prepared. Painwheel, Robo-Fortune, this ASG project is long overdue for decommissioning. Get rid of her and bring me the Skull Heart!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_0": "How could I miscalculate this power?! No! Stay away!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_10": "My decades of research cannot die with me! What will satisfy you, sadist!?",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_20": "Sadist? None of this gives me joy.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_30": "When I carve up your precious grey matter piece by piece... \nthen you'll understand what it means to truly lose something.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_40": "I should have left you to die when I had the chance.\nI saw a potential in you I would have been wiser to never see realized.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_50": "Do I know you? My memory isn't what it used to be– and neither will yours, when I'm finished.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_60": "I do not fear death. Losing my research is another matter, however.\nIf you will not listen to reason, I am prepared to accept a temporary setback.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_70": "Farewell, erstwhile prototype.\nAssuming you survive this, I will ensure my next body is sufficiently prepared to deal with you permanently.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_80": "What?!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_90": "Ma’am!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_100": "Ms. Dahlia! Are you alright?!",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_110": "*cough, cough* Oh dear, I should have expected a trick at the last moment.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_120": "I'll accept the promise of a future playdate in return for you ruining this one. Not a fair trade, but what could be, these days?",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_130": "Bunnies, inform Lorenzo we have the Life Gem.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_140": "Not the outcome either of us wished for, yet you succeeded.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_150": "This disappointment is all too familiar. If I couldn't bear it in stride, I wouldn't have lasted this long.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_160": "Perhaps the days this world can surprise me are no longer. ",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_170": "With my own power, I've claimed victory once again, and once again I am left with nothing.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_180": "Yet, if I could imagine a wish that would fulfill this gnawing desire, I might be tempted to make one at this point. I'm almost as desperate as that young girl you so recently tempted.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_190": "The wishes of the desperate are predictable and foolish.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_200": "However, if you were to make a wish, Dahlia, I wonder if it would be more interesting than another desperate girl hoping her selfishness might make the world right again.",
 "Dahlia_Fight6_Outro_210": "...",
 "Dahlia_Outro_0": "Well done, Dahlia.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_10": "...",
 "Dahlia_Outro_20": "What, no cutting quip? I gave you permission to paint the town red, and from what I've heard you all but ran out of paint. Are you not sufficiently entertained’?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_30": "The evening started out so promising, but by the end it was simply... routine.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_40": "The price of being too good at your job, Dahlia? You've surpassed my expectations once again.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_50": "I barely met my own.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_60": "Insatiable. Not a bad trait in someone like you.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_70": "Cheer up, old girl. With my Life Gem returned and the Skull Heart in my possession, we can set our sights much higher than we ever have before.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_80": "It’s time to take a shot at the throne of the Canopy Kingdom, and from there... who knows? Chances for you to test your limits over and over. After things have settled down here, of course.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_90": "Perhaps I'll have a chance to die in combat before I die of boredom.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_100": "Is that truly the most entertaining future you can imagine, Dahlia?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_110": "...",
 "Dahlia_Outro_120": "Business as usual? Back to being a dog so rarely let off her leash? He let you free for the first time in years, and it was a string of one disappointment after another.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_130": "Perhaps the world simply no longer has the chance to surprise me.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_140": "You do not believe this. Are you not still alive, at this moment? Continuing to take one step after another, despite your heart wreathed in what other humans might call despair?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_150": "Does that not prove you still have... hope?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_160": "Dahlia, where is the gem? Stop mumbling to that skull.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_170": "Of course, you can go back to Lorenzo and continue to let time take your chances from you. But surely, given all the risks you take, why not take a chance on me?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_180": "Your Life Gem, Mr. Medici.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_190": "Ah. Finally. Finally! Ahahaha, there is no man, woman, or force on earth that can best Lorenzo Medici!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_200": "You certainly are persistent. What makes you think my wish will be so entertaining?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_210": "“She who is pure of heart will have her wish granted by the Skull Heart.” Though many whisper this, none understand what purity truly is.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_220": "Wishing cheats the outcome, undoes the good it sets out to do. How can a world be fixed by such intervention? It cannot. You must bridge this contradiction.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_230": "Oh, and the Skull Heart as well. It might be more trouble than it’s worth, but I can put it to use somehow.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_240": "You're different, Dahlia. You have no desire to save others nor do you harbor selfish material desires. You feel true ecstasy when mortals overcome their pain and become stronger than ever before. ",
 "Dahlia_Outro_245": "Their triumphs and failures are both beautiful to you and you do not desire to ‘fix’ them.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_250": "Dahlia? Pay attention. Don't make me lose my patience.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_260": "You understand this world is a lie and the only truth is that which is gambled out of it every day by the struggle of mortals.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_270": "On the billion-to-one chance that you understand the truth of this world, all I ask is this. Black Dahlia, what is the pure wish of your pure, tempered soul?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_280": "...",
 "Dahlia_Outro_290": "Dahlia! What’s taking so long? The Skull Heart, now!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_300": "SHUT UP! I’m THINKING, Lorenzo!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_310": "*Guhgh... ack* Wh–why...?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_320": "Aren't you dead? Oh right, the Life Gem. I'll take that.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_330": "Now that's finally taken care of. Don't interrupt me while I'm thinking.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_340": "M-Ma’am?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_350": "I know dear, it’s awfully inconvenient, but do keep quiet for a moment while I sort this out, or you're next, understood?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_360": "*gulp*",
 "Dahlia_Outro_370": "I want to face the truth of myself and know I was right to throw everything away. To live for nothing but the thrill, and know that nothing else exists.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_380": "And I want everyone to face that truth and come away knowing what their true selves are. I’d like to see the smile that was carved in me on every face.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_390": "So they know and understand who they really are and what this world really is!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_400": "Everyone? Not just yourself?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_410": "It has no meaning if it’s just for me, does it? I want everyone to know the same joy I do! ",
 "Dahlia_Outro_420": "Yes... yes. That is enough for me. The day you wish for exists. I was born solely for the purpose of bringing it about.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_430": "I have no joy, no hope, and no purpose but this one. Yet consider me... entertained.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_440": "Goodbye, Dahlia. I am no longer needed in the world you wish into existence. Your pure heart's wish is granted. Come, and witness the world's true shape.",
 "Dahlia_Outro_450": "Oh ho ho ho! What new expressions will I see? Every moment is glorious!\nThere’s a surprise around every corner and death is everywhere!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_460": "Isn't Ms. Dahlia so happy?",
 "Dahlia_Outro_470": "She’s so gorgeous when she smiles!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_480": "Ahahahahah DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE!!!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_490": "This is it girls! Now, how long can we last? Don’t wear yourselves out too quickly!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_500": "We have to last at least until the goddesses descend!",
 "Dahlia_Outro_510": "I'm sure to die, but what if I’m a match for them, too? Oh, I can't wait to see!",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_0": "Behind you! Wait, there’s ammo over there! Come on, use your grenades, what are you saving them for?!",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_10": "Slow down! Stop backseating!",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_20": "This is the last level, come on! You're about to beat it!",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_30": "Careful, don’t–",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_40": "What happened!? We were just getting to the good part!!",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_50": "You kicked the console.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_60": "WHAT?! That time it couldn't have been me! YOU were the one sitting next to it!",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_70": "That timeline had a lot of promise, too! Please tell me you saved before that fight.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_80": "I don't know if I can find a one-in-a-billion possibility so easily again.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_90": "You're kidding meeeeeeee. I've never seen how it ends, and we were so close.\nCome on, just start a new game! We can beat it this time.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_100": "That game gives me motion sickness. I'm taking a break. Something relaxing this time, like a RPG.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_110": "Please no, RPGs are so boring. \nYou always stop right at the endgame and grind out sidequests instead of just finishing it.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_120": "Just thinking about it makes me antsy. I can't stand being cooped up playing games. I'm going out.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_130": "\"Out?\" There's nowhere for us to go, as long as we're stuck here.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_140": "I'm not going to let that stop me. This prison is getting weaker every day.\nSomeday there'll be a crack big enough for me to slip through.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_150": "Besides, what kind of sister would I be if I made you do all the work? So come on, it'll be fun.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_160": "Maybe... later.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_170": "Suit yourself. But don't you want at least a peek at the real world? It's more interesting than RPGs.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_180": "I miss it, but... I don't know.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_190": "Hey, don't sulk. I know you tried your best.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_200": "We're getting closer. One day we'll walk in the sun together again and no one will be able to stop us.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_210": "I miss the sun too.",
 "Dahlia_PostCredit_220": "... but if you'd seen what’s waiting after the credits, you wouldn't want the game to end either.",

Her arsenal includes tricks and traps to ensnare her prey, and tools to chase down her target with unrelenting violence.\n\nShe sports a gun for an arm which she can load with six different types of ammo.

 "Marie_Flashback2_190": "It was very, very kind of you.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_200": "Everyone was running and screaming, and I tripped and fell.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_210": "Then something horrible, it came out of the ground, and... I don't remember anything after that.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_220": "You were hurt quite badly. The city was all but lost, and there was no place left in the capital that could care for you.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_230": "So, I made the decision to take you as far away from that place as I could. I hope you can forgive the recklessness of my driving, though you slept through it all.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_240": "What about your grandson?",
 "Marie_Flashback2_250": "I... do not know. All I know is that you, a child right in front of my eyes, needed help.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_260": "Oh no! You shouldn’t have!",
 "Marie_Flashback2_270": "I had to! I couldn’t well leave you there. I may have been a fool, rushing madly into danger, but at least I found you.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_280": "Let’s speak no more of it. For my grandson, I can only hope. For you, there is stew and rest.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_290": "My mother and father... did you see them?",
 "Marie_Flashback2_300": "...I think you should finish your stew first, and then we can talk about what to do next.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_310": "It may be that neither of us can return to Rommelgrad for some time. For now, hope is all we have.",
 "Marie_Flashback2_320": "Ah, but first, I must know your name. Can you introduce yourself?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_0": "Mr. Hilgard...?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_10": "Oh... a dream.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_30": "Can Skullgirls dream? Or am I finally dead?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_40": "You're heavy is what you are! Get OFF!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_50": "Patricia? What are you doing there?!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_60": "You fell on me, doofus!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_90": "But at least you're Marie now. Right? You ain't gonna throw a buncha skeletons around and talk about how weak I am?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_100": "I didn't say it THAT much. But I feel... strange. I feel... better?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_120": "WE DID IT! Squigly better be alive so I can rub it in her face. “Oh, I’m so sorry for doubting your genius, Peacock. I’m just a dumb zombie! I love nagging and eating brains!”",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_140": "How did you even do... whatever it was you did?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_150": "We bent the Ginormous Cosmic Timeosphere to try and fling the Skull Heart out of this universe, but it hated that so much it turned into a bunch of crystals and exploded!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_180": "The... what?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_190": "Dr. Avian calls it the \"space-time continuum.\" But that's super boring so I came up with a WAY better name. Cool, Right?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_210": "I guess, but... what is this feeling? Like a tiny candle inside my chest. A fragment of the Skull Heart?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_215": "It's very warm, but also very cold. Is this shard what's keeping me alive? ",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_220": "Probably! The important fact is you’re alive. Well, not technically, but you know what I mean! We can let the Lab 8 nerds figure out the rest.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_260": "I suppose it is just one more mystery... like what happened to you. You have metal teeth, metal arms, and no eyes. Oh, there's so much I want to ask you, Patricia, and so much I need to tell you.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_270": "But we have to get out of here first. This is Gehenna, Double’s domain, and there are worse things in this place than even her.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_280": "Me, for instance, if I do flatter myself.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_300": "Valentine! Marie, aren’t you her boss? Tell her she's fired!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_310": "She has no reason to obey me anymore... and every reason to want revenge.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_320": "Fine, plan B. Avery, get us out of here!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_330": "Uh... Avery? Helllooooo? Don’t be cute, just get us out of here!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_340": "Damn it! Did he get lost when the Skull Heart went kaboom?!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_350": "Now what do we have here? A Skullgirl without the Skull Heart? It should be impossible... yet here you are.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_360": "I'll happily put aside revenge to give this medical curiosity a thorough dissection. Purely in the interest of science, of course.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_370": "With Brain Drain’s help, I presume?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_380": "Say what you will about his methods, the man gets results.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_390": "I knew you’d return to your true master eventually. I'm only surprised you haven't become tired of serving one after another.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_420": "It's just more efficient to work with those who share my goals.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_430": "Even ours aligned. You understand as well as I do that authority and morality just get in the way of doing what needs to be done.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_440": "I... did horrible things. Things that can’t be forgiven. The price for stopping the Medici was much too great.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_450": "Please don’t let your resolve weaken now, Marie. That’s the one thing I respected about you.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_470": "That's why taking you down isn't revenge for Last Hope. It's simple efficiency. I don't need excuses and neither do you. We have a simple disagreement over methodology, and there's only one way to resolve it.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_500": "...Fine. As you wish, Valentine.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Intro_510": "I will make this as simple as possible.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_0": "One fragment of the Skull Heart still has this much power? Impossible. How can you still control your undead minions at all, let alone this many of them?!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_10": "For how weak you were as a Skullgirl, you really are a tenacious little brat.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_20": "... But... I didn't call for them?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_30": "Interesting, but I suppose this is a mystery I won't get the chance to solve.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_50": "You should know exactly what to do. The most efficient method of making sure I don't ruin your plans again.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_60": "I'm tired of efficiency.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_70": "I don't want your pity. Save it for someone who deserves it.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_80": "Double told me to kill you. I did not want to follow her orders.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_90": "And I don't want to follow yours, either. That is my resolve. I don't want to be like either of you.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_100": "If you let me live, I WILL kill you. I know how dangerous you still are.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_110": "Go ahead. Once you’ve paid the rest of your debts, I’ll gladly let you settle this one.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_130": "Ha. It’s a deal, then.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_140": "Hey, I hate to interrupt, but if you hurt Marie, I’ll totally kill you! You also attacked Lab 8, so ya know I might have to give you the what for here and now!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_150": "I attacked under orders from Double and the Skullgirl. Shouldn't she bear some responsibility, too?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_160": "That’s... well... but... ERGH, just shut up!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_170": "Oh dear. It’s almost like a perpetual cycle of violence and revenge doesn’t really get you anything other than a lot of dead bodies.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_180": "There’s a lesson there for you, children, but not for me.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_190": "Are you okay, Marie?",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_200": "Y-yes. Thank you, Patricia.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_210": "You’re lying. You always do this. You pushed yourself way too hard!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_220": "I know. I’m sorry, but it really isn’t as bad as it looks.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_230": "Oh, jeez! If you’re agreeing AND apologizing, it must be worse than I thought.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_240": "I’m not that contrarian!",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_250": "Oh good, that’s better.",
 "Marie_Fight2_Outro_260": "I mean... oh goodness, I can’t win.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_0": "Sniff... sniff...",
 "Marie_Flashback3_10": "Oh dear, Marie. Come now, there’s nothing for you to still be crying over, is there?",
 "Marie_Flashback3_20": "B-but there is! I broke the television and we'll never be able to get another!!",
 "Marie_Flashback3_30": "At least a TV is all that was broken! From the way you two were fighting, I feared a bone or two might have become a casualty.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_40": "But we were so bad. I was trying to help, but I just made a mess and Patricia hates me more than ever.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_50": "Well, it certainly was a mess, and I’m certainly not happy about it. But, I’m more worried about you two than I am about the mansion's furniture.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_60": "R-really?",
 "Marie_Flashback3_70": "Whyever would you think a television is worth such a fuss?",
 "Marie_Flashback3_80": "You’re letting us stay here, you're taking care of us, and you don’t ask for anything in return. We’re not your children. We’re not even related.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_90": "If we make too much trouble, you won't want to keep us anymore.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_100": "But Patricia always makes trouble. She won’t study. She won’t make friends. She won’t behave.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_110": "She makes me so mad sometimes, but I don’t want her to have to leave. You won’t throw her out, will you?",
 "Marie_Flashback3_120": "Marie, listen to me.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_130": "I will never abandon you nor any of the other children, no matter how many televisions you break or how much mud you track into the castle.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_140": "We have so little in these times but each other. I’ve lost one family already. I will keep the one we've made here as close as I can.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_150": "Even Patricia?",
 "Marie_Flashback3_160": "Of course! Ones like her, who are so troubled and hurt, need patience the most.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_170": "Patricia might even have a thing or two to teach YOU about having fun and forgetting your troubles. You can be rather too serious at times, Marie.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_180": "Right now, Patricia needs your friendship more than a scolding. A friendship I think you need as well.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_190": "But... I've already ruined everything. I should have just left her alone.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_200": "I have a feeling that no matter how grumpily she behaves, deep down, she’s glad there's someone who cares about her enough to keep bothering her.",
 "Marie_Flashback3_210": "So, if you’d like to keep trying, I have an idea.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_0": "Helloooooo, earth to Marie! You okay?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_10": "Hmm? Oh, I'm fine. I really am, but with the Skull Heart gone, memories I didn't even realize were missing are rushing back.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_30": "Phew, I was kinda worried you were gonna turn evil again or something, but you're still your old self! It's like nothing happened. I knew it was still you under all that.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_70": "Patricia, the Skull Heart didn't really make me do anything. It took away all of my feelings except for those of revenge, but that desire for revenge– it was all mine.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_80": "I thought I was strong enough to control it, but everything I did only took me further down the path Double had planned for me.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_110": "Wasn't all bad though, right? Someone needs to kick bad guy butt. That’s why I saved you after all.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_120": "You... did? For what?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_130": "You said yourself you were pretty good at controlling the Skull Heart. You even managed to kill almost all of the Medici with it.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_140": "So it’s simple. You just need to finish what you started.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_150": "If there’s no saving us, we should go save other people!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_160": "More than the Medici. You can go further than that. This whole world needs saving.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_180": "N-no. I hate the Medici so much, even still, but I can’t keep using this power. It almost killed you! ",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_190": "Something even worse might happen if you don't do anything– hey, what's that?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_195": "AAAAGH!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_200": "PATRICIA?!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_210": "Oh my, I’m quite clumsy! I missed my target by a millimeter and hit some old trash instead.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_220": "Marie... it’s dark...",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_230": "No no no no no, this can’t be happening, not now!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_240": "Of course it’s happening. It’s the natural fate of those who challenge the Medici.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_250": "I’ve been waiting for a chance to take another crack at you, Skullgirl, so don’t just sit around crying.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_260": "You... have... to... finish... it... Marie...",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_270": "No, Patricia, I can’t!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_280": "...... Please, make your wish... come true...",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_290": "My... wish?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_300": "... Get revenge... for all of us...",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_320": "... That's wrong, Patricia. That wasn't my wish.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_330": "Not going to resist then, are you? I’ll make it quick. You've outlived your usefulness many times over.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_340": "Silence. This charade is disgusting even by your standards.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_350": "Do you think Patricia is so easy to imitate that you could fool me with this mockery?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_360": "Oh deAr... iT sEEms shE’S still tOO cleVeR by hALF.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_370": "eRRrrrgGh... playing multiple roles at once is taxing work, even in Gehenna.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_380": "I thought the face of the Medici you so despise would remind you of your purpose.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_390": "Tell me what you've done with Patricia!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Intro_400": "This is for your own good, Marie. Don’t you want your wish to come true?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_0": "Please, this is my fight! You don't need to protect me anymore, minions.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_10": "Your will burns so cold and bright even still. The fact that one shard holds this much power over the dead is a testament to the might of our masters. All the more reason it must be returned to them.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_20": "Though you have ruined so much, the open arms of the Goddesses will embrace you even now.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_30": "I will never obey you again, Double!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_40": "My most obstinate and willful Skullgirl. If only that very will was not what we needed so badly.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_50": "Time and again your will has buckled only to come back stronger, more beautiful, shining like a polished pearl. But now, my precious Skullgirl, the time has come for you to offer it to the goddesses you serve.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_60": "I am not your Skullgirl, and I won't be deceived by your twisted wishes ever again!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_70": "Precious child, did you not share our wish? The goddesses understand how much this terrible and unfair world has made you suffer.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_80": "You still have a chance. With that precious shard of the Skull Heart, you can make the wish that will save this world.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_90": "At every turn you manipulated me and countless others! No wish that comes from this monstrosity could ever help anyone.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_100": "Poor thing, have you not yet realized that death is the only cure for this world's corruption and evil? When did you lose that merciless conviction?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_110": "Was the incident with Lab 8 too much for you? I knew you could not be convinced to act in your own self-interest. You needed a nudge.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_120": "You lied to me! Tricked me into killing innocent people!",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_130": "They were children kidnapped by slavers, modified into killing machines, including your precious friend. Did I lie?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_140": "They were afraid and hurt! I destroyed their family and their home... I did exactly what the slavers did to us...",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_150": "You could have swept them into the loving embrace of death where there is no pain or brokenness.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_160": "Instead, I was forced to finish the job, and you avoided neither the outcome nor the responsibility. Your hesitation to remove these obstacles is what led to your ultimate defeat.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_170": "Obstacles to YOUR plans, not mine. After my revenge was complete, what would it matter what happened to me?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_180": "You... perhaps you are more shrewd than I gave you credit for. Were you actually HOPING Lab 8 would exterminate you after you were done with the Medici?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_190": "Once I got my wish, why would I care if there was still a Skullgirl remaining to do your dirty work?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_200": "What clever double-dealing. Pity you never got your wish, and without us, you never will. You need us far more than we need you.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_210": "Patricia saved me. What can you offer me that's better than hope?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_220": "Hope? A castle of sand against the rising waves. It will never last, no matter how you cling to it.",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_240": "What can a poor lost child like you do without the guidance of the Goddesses?",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_250": "There you are, Marie! I've been looking for you for ages. Some goon who looked like you was messin' with me and–",
 "Marie_Fight3_Outro_260": "Hey, you okay?",
 "Marie_Flashback4_0": "[knock knock]",
 "Marie_Flashback4_10": "[knock knock knock]",
 "Marie_Flashback4_20": "[Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock Knock]",
 "Marie_Flashback4_30": "CUT IT OUT!",
 "Marie_Flashback4_40": "Oh, you ARE awake! Can I come in?",
 "Marie_Flashback4_50": "NO! Leave me alone! You’re just here to lord it over me! Perfect little Marie never gets in trouble.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_60": "That’s not true. I got in trouble, too.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_70": "But Mr. Hilgard said if we make up, he'll unground both of us.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_80": "Feh, who cares. It’s not like I can watch TV anyway.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_90": "The only fun thing left to do is stare at this wall. And I'd rather do it ALONE.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_100": "Well, I guess I’ll just keep this Annie of the Stars Official Coloring Book to myself then. You probably wouldn’t want it.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_110": "... Are you fibbin' with me?",
 "Marie_Flashback4_120": "I don’t know. Why don't you fib around and find out?",
 "Marie_Flashback4_130": "Fine. But I’m gonna kick your butt if you’re lying, I don’t care WHAT Mr. Hilgard does.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_140": "Wait, is this the limited edition one?!",
 "Marie_Flashback4_150": "Limited edition? Is that special?",
 "Marie_Flashback4_160": "Yeah it’s special! I never thought I’d see one of these again. Gimme!",
 "Marie_Flashback4_170": "ONLY if we share it!",
 "Marie_Flashback4_180": "Ugh, seriously? Why?",
 "Marie_Flashback4_190": "If we can finish this coloring book together without a fight, Mr. Hilgard will unground us. That's the deal.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_200": "You could just share it with one of your real friends. Everyone likes you.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_210": "But you love Annie more than anyone. Doesn't that make you the best person to have this?",
 "Marie_Flashback4_220": "Ha, you’ll probably just color inside the lines like a nerd.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_230": "Isn't that what you're supposed to do?",
 "Marie_Flashback4_240": "Who cares? It’s a coloring book! Do whatever you want! Chaos reigns!",
 "Marie_Flashback4_260": "But you're SUPPOSED to color inside the lines. That's the whole point.",
 "Marie_Flashback4_270": "Didn't Mr. Hilgard say we had to get along? Come on, it'll be fun. Let's color the grass red and the sky purple!",
 "Marie_Flashback4_280": "Okay, but just this once.",
 "Marie_Intermission_0": "Are you sure this is the right way? It feels like we’ve been running in circles for hours.",
 "Marie_Intermission_10": "We're almost there. I can feel a breeze from the surface.",
 "Marie_Intermission_20": "Here! Come on, Patricia!",
 "Marie_Intermission_30": "What’s going on? Where the heck are we? Did we take a wrong turn at Sombrillaquerque?",
 "Marie_Intermission_60": "It feels familiar somehow. I think this must be what's left of the village of Jakoogsburg.",
 "Marie_Intermission_70": "What? How the heck could we be back near the old orphanage? And how can you tell? It's just a bunch of smoldering wreckage, like everything else out here.",
 "Marie_Intermission_80": "Because this is where Double and I hid before we came to New Meridian.",
 "Marie_Intermission_90": "Wait, that gross place stretches into other COUNTRIES?! Just how big is that freaky place?",
 "Marie_Intermission_100": "Gehenna is enormous. It doesn't just connect this place to New Meridian. It extends all over the Canopy Kingdom, the continent... maybe even the world.",
 "Marie_Intermission_160": "Still, we should keep moving. Double wouldn't give up so easily.",
 "Marie_Intermission_170": "Dang it, if I still had Avery, we’d be back to New Meridian in a couple hours tops.",
 "Marie_Intermission_180": "Avery? ",
 "Marie_Intermission_190": "Yeah, he's my best friend, besides you. He helps me operate the synthetic parasite in my back.",
 "Marie_Intermission_200": "I... see. Wait, why can't you operate your parasite without him? Is it broken?",
 "Marie_Intermission_210": "I mean, technically I can, but do you have any idea how much math you need to do to warp the fabric of the Ginormous Cosmic Timeosphere without killing yourself and everything around you?!",
 "Marie_Intermission_220": "I made Avery so I’d never have to think about the math again. Why do math yourself when you can imagine someone else who's really good at math to do it for you?",
 "Marie_Intermission_225": "Besides, Avery loves math. He also loves knives, because they’re basically the same thing.",
 "Marie_Intermission_230": "Can’t YOU still do the math, since you made him? Wait, how is math like knives?",
 "Marie_Intermission_240": "You sound like the doc. “Patricia, why did you make Avery love knives so much? It is very dangerous!”",
 "Marie_Intermission_250": "But I tells him, “Listen, you're always going on about how much math you need to bend the fabric of reality. Well if it's fabric, just cut it with a knife! Why are you using math? THAT'S what doesn't make sense.\"",
 "Marie_Intermission_280": "Man, I can’t wait to introduce you to the rest of the Lab 8 gang! You’re gonna hit it off, I know it.",
 "Marie_Intermission_290": "Sure they were all designed to kill you, but once they get over that, we’re all gonna be best buds.",
 "Marie_Intermission_310": "I’m not so sure if I should come back with you.",
 "Marie_Intermission_320": "What are you talking about? If anyone gives you sass I’ll stuff them in a sack! And then I’ll stuff that sack in the river! And then I’ll stuff that river in the sun. And I’ll stuff that sun–",
 "Marie_Intermission_325": "Owww!",
 "Marie_Intermission_330": "Are you okay? What’s wrong?!",
 "Marie_Intermission_340": "Arms are on the fritz. I just need some maintenance... and a sandwich.",
 "Marie_Intermission_350": "What do you need a sandwich for? Is it necessary for your repair?",
 "Marie_Intermission_360": "It’s necessary to eat. What else am I going to do with a sandwich?",
 "Marie_Intermission_370": "Right... you need food. I forgot.",
 "Marie_Intermission_380": "It’s been a long time since I had to think about eating.",
 "Marie_Intermission_390": "Not to state the obvious, but being the Skullgirl sounds like it sucks.",
 "Marie_Intermission_400": "Having to eat can be a pain, but you get to EAT!",
 "Marie_Intermission_410": "At least we only have to find one sandwich.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_0": "Hey, what’s that, off in the distance? It looks like a bunch of cars... no... motorcycles!?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_10": "People, in No Man’s Land? This can’t be good.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_20": "Hey, don’t be such a downer. Maybe they’ll give us a lift.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_30": "What if they're bad guys?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_40": "Then we'll save the day by heroically beating them up and then we'll take their motorcycles!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_50": "Patricia, that... might be an okay idea, actually?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_60": "Of course it is. I might not have my gadgets, but I’ve still got my genius!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_70": "They look like Canopy Kingdom soldiers.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_100": "Stand back, Patricia. I can't let you get hurt.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_110": "Hey, stop trying to be a hero!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_115": "Oww! Damn it! This isn’t the kind of Argus agony I had in mind!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_120": "Egrets, hold your fire. Let me talk to them alone.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_130": "Who's this broad?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_135": "Wait, you look familiar. You weren't a guest on the Annie of the Stars winter special, were you?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_140": "What?! I-I was in disguise, no one could have–",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_145": "... Ahem, excuse me. Now is not the time for that.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_150": "I am the Crown Princess of the Canopy Kingdom, Parasoul Renoir.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_160": "Surrender, Skullgirl. If you do, we can end this peacefully. No one has to get hurt.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_170": "Wait, listen! Marie’s good now! I blew up the Skull Heart and fixed her. She doesn't have an evil bone left in her body. Except the tiny crystally one keeping her alive, but she's got that under control.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_180": "It’s because she has acted with such unusual restraint for a Skullgirl that I even considered the risk I'm taking now.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_190": "Please, Marie. Give yourself up. We can protect your friend and help her live a normal life. But in exchange, you’ll have to let us study you before–",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_210": "–before you destroy me?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_220": "Others have tried to resist the Skull Heart... but no one has succeeded. Even very strong, very kind people.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_230": "Not even the best intentions can last forever.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_240": "Hah, shows you what you know! Marie's so stubborn, her good intentions CAN last forever!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_250": "I’m sorry, Princess. I do think your actions are correct. I know I don't deserve another chance.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_275": "Even so, I can’t say no to my friend. She’s the most important person to me.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_280": "I see. I wish I could believe you, but I've seen the strongest person I know taken by the Skull Heart.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Intro_290": "And I must protect my kingdom, no matter what!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_0": "We’ve failed. Egrets, retreat!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_10": "Skullgirl, your struggles will only end in further tragedy for you and those you love.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_20": "I will stop you. I only hope it's before that happens.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_30": "I survived... again.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_40": "Why do you still fight for me, minions? I told you, this isn’t your battle!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_50": "Marie?! Hey, you okay?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_60": "I’m fine.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_70": "You seriously expectin' me to believe that? You look halfway dead!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_80": "In that case, I must look halfway better than normal.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_90": "...........................",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_100": "T-that was a joke. Because I'm dead? Oh but I'm undead, so I was already half-dead... maybe it doesn't make any sense.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_110": "No, I got it. It was funny. It was so funny, and I mean this seriously, that I forgot to laugh. Are you SURE you're okay? Seein' as you're doing crazy things like \"making jokes\"?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_120": "I really am fine, I promise, but... did I really do the right thing?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_130": "Yes! Stop asking if it was the \"right\" thing! The thing that keeps you around is good enough for me. Come on, let’s get moving.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_140": "Where to?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_150": "Well, where else is there? There's nothing left in this burned-out village, and the only other place for miles around is the old orphanage.",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_160": "I'm... not sure we should go there...",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_170": "There might be food in a pantry somewhere, and hopefully there’s still at least part of a roof left. What, are you afraid of ghosts? You’re the Skullgirl, remember?",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_180": "I’m not scared of ghosts!",
 "Marie_Fight4_Outro_190": "... But I am scared.",
 "Marie_Flashback5_0": "What’s all that noise? Who could be causing such a ruckus at this hour?",
 "Marie_Flashback5_10": "I hope Patricia’s not raiding the kitchen again.",
 "Marie_Flashback5_15": "But if she is... maybe just one cookie won't hurt.",
 "Marie_Flashback5_20": "Wait, was that... a scream?!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_40": "What’s happening?!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_50": "Marie! There you are! We have to go, now!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_60": "Look, there’s two more! We’re gonna be rich!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_70": "That tip we got was right on the money.",
 "Marie_Flashback5_80": "HELP!!! Mr. Hilgard!!!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_90": "We’ve already taken care of the maids and the old man. So be a good girl and come over here.",
 "Marie_Flashback5_100": "Fat chance!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_110": "OW! Damn it!!! I’ll make you pay when I get my hands on you!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_120": "Don’t you dare lay a hand on her!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_130": "Mr. Hilgard, you’re hurt!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_140": "Never mind that! Leave, now! Look for help in the village!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_150": "But Mr. Hilgard!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_160": "NOW!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_170": "How? How could this happen?!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_180": "We were set up! Someone in the village tipped ‘em off.",
 "Marie_Flashback5_190": "We have to go back... the others... Mr. Hilgard!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_200": "We can’t help ‘em if we get caught too! Now keep running! You’re the one who made me exercise. Now, move those legs!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_210": "*Huff* *huff* *huff*",
 "Marie_Flashback5_220": "I can’t... keep up... please, Patricia, just go on...",
 "Marie_Flashback5_240": "I think I saw something over here!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_250": "Damn it, these knuckleheads... I’ll lead them the other way. That should buy you some time. You just have to make it to the village!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_260": "What about you?!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_270": "They won’t catch me that easy! I know the woods way better than they do.",
 "Marie_Flashback5_280": "Now go!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_290": "HEY BOZOS, BET YOU CAN’T CATCH ME!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_300": "Hey! That’s the one that got Johnny! Get her!",
 "Marie_Flashback5_310": "Patricia!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_0": "Owwwieee, come on quit it! I'm fine. It's just a skinned knee.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_10": "We can't risk it getting infected, now hold still.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_20": "You always make such a big deal out of everything.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_30": "And you never take anything seriously until it’s too late!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_40": "You worry too much!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_50": "You don’t worry enough!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_60": "Know it all!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_70": "Slacker!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_80": "I know you are but– pfft ahahahahahahaha!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_90": "Hehehehe.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_100": "Being back here with you, it's almost as if nothing changed.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_110": "Hey, are you okay? You’ve been acting weird since we started climbing the mountain.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_120": "I’m fine.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_130": "Yeah, keep saying that. I believe it more and more each time.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_140": "That was sarcasm, by the way, one of my most powerful new abilities.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_150": "I'm pretty sure that's an ability you've always had, Patricia.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_160": "Still, I'm fine. You're the one we need to worry about. Tomorrow, we can figure how to get you back to New Meridian before I--",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_170": "Before you what?! I knew it! Something IS wrong with you.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_180": "I-I'm fine... I'm...",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_190": "I'm really happy you came for me, Patricia. Really. I mean it.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_200": "Even just a little bit more time with you is enough. This happiness is more than I deserve.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_210": "But... I can't stay like this. This shard of the Skull Heart is too dangerous, and it's only a matter of time before Double attacks us again.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_220": "It's obvious what I have to do.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_230": "Course it is! You gotta journey all over the world, with your best bud of course, to find a way to bring you all the way back to life, foiling Double's plans and having adventures along the way. Right?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_240": "Patricia... I’m sorry, but no one should have this power, especially not me.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_250": "Once you're safe... I'm going to make sure this shard of the Skull Heart is destroyed.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_260": "Are you crazy?! You know what'll happen to you then, right?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_270": "I've made up my mind, Patricia. I tried to fight the Skull Heart and the Medici on my own terms, but didn't I only make things worse?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_280": "No!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_290": "Oh, so I made things \"better\" when I helped destroy your new home, your new family, and put the whole world in danger for my selfish wish.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_300": "Okay, you've made some mistakes, but did you ever think of how it could have been a lot worse?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_310": "You coulda rampaged like any other Skullgirl, but you tried to be all sneaky. You only attacked the Medici, and you even caught a falling tower to save lives. Yeah, Squigly told me about that last one.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_315": "No other Skullgirl woulda done that. You didn't let yourself lose control.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_320": "But what if I do lose control? I'm still a Skullgirl, Patricia. Even now, I feel the Skull Heart calling me.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_325": "It would be so simple to give in to it. I wouldn't have to deal with all this guilt, all this pain... I could just go back to finishing off the last of the Medici.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_330": "I shouldn't be thinking like that, but I can’t stop!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_340": "Then fight it! You shouldn't let Double or the Skull Heart or any other idiot tell you what to do.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_350": "Even you?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_360": "Not even me!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_370": "Wait, I mean... gah. I'm not telling you what to do. I'm saying you should be yourself. Be the stubborn, annoying, know-it-all, wannabe maid that wouldn't leave me alone.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_390": "You didn't give up on me back then. I'm not giving up on you now. So don't give up on yourself, Marie!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_400": "Please, Patricia, can't you honor this last wish of mine? I just want to get you somewhere safe, where you can be happy, and then–",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_410": "No, I hate this! It sucks!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_420": "Giving up isn’t like you at all. That’s why you’re such a pain in the ass, and that's why you're my best friend!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_430": "Enough, Patricia. I've made up my mind. Besides, what are you going to do to stop me in your condition?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_440": "I'll fight you!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_450": "What!? No, Patricia, you're still hurt!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_460": "I don't care. I'm not giving up on you, even if it means I have to fight you! Again!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Intro_470": "So if you want me to do things your way, to go back to New Meridian and be safe, you’re going to have to drag me there kicking and screaming!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_0": "There! Stop being so stubborn and LISTEN!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_10": "Ha... okay, fine, you got me good. I know when I’m licked.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_20": "You gave me so much trouble! That was dangerous. At least I’m already dead, but you... why are you laughing?!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_30": "Hahahahah, oh man!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_40": "What’s so funny?! You could have gotten hurt!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_50": "You’re so stubborn you forgot to lose.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_55": "... What!?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_60": "You coulda thrown the fight. If one of my beams hit that piece of the Skull Heart, it coulda been blown to smithereens. But noooo, Marie has to be right about everything, every time.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_80": "That... I... You... ",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_90": "I... back at the orphanage, I was sure I knew what was best for everyone, but it never turned out right. As the Skullgirl, I thought I could fix everything, but I only brought more death.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_100": "Worst of all, you keep getting hurt because of me.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_110": "Hey, what are friends for?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_120": "And sure I've saved you a couple times now. I am awesome, after all.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_130": "But it took a lot more work for you to save me at first, so I'd say we're even.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_140": "Whenever did I save you?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_150": "Back at the orphanage, when all I wanted to do was watch TV.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_160": "You mean when all I ever did was bother and nag you? You hated that!",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_170": "I REALLY hated it! Your nagging is the worst... but have to admit, you were right.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_180": "I needed friends. I needed to play outside and share coloring books. I needed to live. If you hadn't made me, I don't know if I would have made it.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_200": "But in the end we still lost everything. You were always afraid everything would all fall apart, and you were right. It did, in the worst possible way.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_210": "Hey, after everything that's happened, we’ve still got each other, right? Sure, we're both missing some pieces, but we've got a ton of cool friends! Like Avery, the fellas, everyone from Lab 8, and even all the dead guys you hang out with.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_220": "I don't understand how the minions keep coming back, or why. I wish they would stop. They deserve to rest.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_230": "Look, I can't tell you what their deal is, but they sure seem attached for some reason. Maybe they’re hanging around for fun, but maybe they see what I see.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_240": "Someone who will try too hard, probably make a mess, but will still manage to keep them safe while saving herself.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_250": "So... I know what I'm gonna do. I'm going to keep kicking ass and fighting for my friends until I'm all outta ass and all outta friends.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_260": "What are you going to do?",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_270": "I...",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_280": "Okay, Patricia, I’ll trust you.",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_290": "Even if it's selfish, or ends badly...",
 "Marie_Fight5_Outro_300": "As long as you believe in me, I’ll keep trying.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_0": "Just... a little... bit... more!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_10": "Please, let there be someone in the village who can help.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_20": "*huff* *huff* *huff*",
 "Marie_Flashback6_30": "Just past these trees...",
 "Marie_Flashback6_40": "......?",
 "Marie_Flashback6_50": "......!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_60": "No... no... NO!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_70": "Is there anyone out there?! Anyone at all?",
 "Marie_Flashback6_80": "Please! We need help!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_90": "Please, somebody!? Hello?!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_120": "What do you need, child?",
 "Marie_Flashback6_130": "Thank goodness. Please, sister, we need help! Raiders attacked Mr. Hilgard’s orphanage!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_140": "They’re trying to kidnap the children, and some people are badly hurt!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_145": "Please, if there’s anything you can do, we need help!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_150": "I am sorry. There is nothing I can do.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_160": "W-what? That can’t be... everyone is counting on me to get help. There must be a way!",
 "Marie_Flashback6_170": "I cannot help you... but that doesn’t mean there is no hope. There may still be a way to help your friends.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_180": "How? I’m clumsy, I’m slow... there’s nothing I can do except beg for help.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_190": "Tell me, child, if you had power, what would you do with it?",
 "Marie_Flashback6_200": "Power? I don’t understand.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_210": "The raiders are stronger than you, so they are able to take what they desire.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_220": "That is the awful way of this corrupt world. If you had the strength, what would you do?",
 "Marie_Flashback6_230": "I’d save my friends! I’d protect them with all my might.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_240": "I’d make a world where we could live together and be happy.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_245": "And I'd make sure that no one could ever take that from us again.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_250": "You needn't run any more, child. The Trinity has heard your pleas.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_260": "Through them, you can have the chance to make everything right again, exactly how you imagine it.",
 "Marie_Flashback6_270": "All you need to do...",
 "Marie_Flashback6_280": "...is wish for it.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_0": "Don’t listen to her! That’s an imposter!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_10": "Patricia?!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_20": "Me?!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_30": "Marie, that’s Double! She’s trying to trick you into–",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_40": "Silence! How dare you try to impersonate Patricia twice.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_50": "As if I couldn’t tell from your stench. You might have been able to trick me in Gehenna, but here you are unmistakable.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_60": "Oh Marie. I sEE you ARE just as stuBBORn as eVeR.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_70": "And just as deluded.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_80": "Double AGAIN?! You almost tricked ME that time. I mean, I knew she wasn’t me all along! At least I was pretty sure she wasn’t.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_90": "I am here not to deceive, but to guide.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_100": "With your shard, you can still make things right and shift the world back onto its proper course.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_110": "What kind of hell is that going to be, huh? It'll be worse than the ending of Bloodbath Disco III! And that ending sucked!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_120": "A hell that will suit her masters, a world no one would ever wish for.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_130": "No one? Countless souls before you have witnessed this world's corruption, and seen the truth - that salvation exists only through the divine intervention of our Goddesses.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_140": "I’ve had enough of this. With the power I have left, I'll at least rid the world of you!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_150": "You may try, but what can you do with your tiny shard of the Skull Heart’s might?",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_160": "She can do plenty, because she's got me!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_165": "Marie, I'm backing you up this time, and I'm not taking no for an answer!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_170": "Patricia, I...",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_175": "Yes! Let's do this, together!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_180": "And what can you two broken tools do?",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_190": "It's not just us! Please, everyone! You're my minions no longer, so I don’t have the right to ask this of you, but we have to stop her!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_200": "You may have been allowed your legions before, but no longer. They will not heed your call.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Intro_210": "We'll see about that.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_0": "Stubborn, insolent, and ignorant! Listen to your masters! It is by their power that you stand anew. You have no will of your own. You exist to execute divine will alone. OBEY!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_20": "No, you're wrong, Double. I can hear them. They've been calling for me, louder than the Skull Heart! They... we will not be puppets anymore. We will not–",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_30": "AAaaa! My head! W-what's happening!?",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_40": "Marie!? What are you doing to her!?",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_50": "I have done nothing. In defending you and attacking me, Marie has finally drawn too deeply of her Skullgirl power.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_60": "She is now being brought to heel.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_70": "No, Marie! You gotta fight it!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_80": "It is futile. Marie Korbel wished upon the Skull Heart. Her wish was impure. She can no longer resist fate. She is the Skullgirl.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_90": "Screw that! YOU'RE the one who rigged this whole game! What’s the point of something that grants wishes if it NEVER ACTUALLY GRANTS YOUR WISHES?!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_100": "To teach you mortals a fundamental truth: your efforts will never grant you happiness or salvation. Your struggles beget nothing but suffering in a world ungoverned by the Trinity.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_110": "Cease resisting. Restore your will to the Trinity, and they will cure the ills you have inflicted upon this world.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_120": "N-no.... I won't...",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_130": "Petulant child, clinging to that which you have stolen. I should not be surprised.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_140": "All born on this world are thieves. Life stolen from their blood. Societies built on their flesh and bone. And yet all sentient creatures have stolen something far more precious still.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_150": "The \"will\" that drives you.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_160": "Our \"will\"? Lady, we were born with it! We can do whatever we want. Watch! Nyeh-nyeh!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_190": "The purpose of the Skull Heart is to return your \"will\" to the goddesses so that they might choose a more proper, deserving fate for you mortals.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_200": "Everything I did... everything was all for them?!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_210": "Poor deluded creature. The Goddesses answered your wish and allowed you the free will to choose revenge. All you did was according to your own will. Tell me, did it make you happy? Did it make the world better?",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_220": "You already know the answer, Marie. You could do nothing on your own. In time, you would have seen the truth all other Skullgirls before you have understood: mortal will cannot make this world right.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_230": "On that day, you would have broken and given yourself to them wholly, becoming a sacrifice of free will great enough for the Trinity to break the cracks of the Abyss and be free once more!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_250": "NO!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_260": "You took advantage of my weakness and desperation back then, but we don’t need your corrupt power anymore. We will create the future we want with our own hands.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_270": "That's right! I already smashed your stupid Skull Heart once, and I'll do it again! I'll smash it so hard your bosses won't be able to mess with Marie's head ever again!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_280": "Marie, you’ve got to fight them! Don’t let them take over!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_290": "Don't worry, Patricia, I won't give up. I'm not afraid anymore. You're with me.",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_300": "And so are they. I can... hear them. The voices of the dead whose will was stolen. They're calling for me to free them... they can't rest yet!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_310": "Together, we'll show The Trinity whose will is stronger!",
 "Marie_Fight6_Outro_320": "That's the ticket! All you gotta do is be as stubborn as you can possibly be! Fight the Skull Heart and kick them out!",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_0": "This has gone on long enough. Show yourself.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_10": "Straight to the point, as always. So willful for someone so young, but that's why we picked you.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_20": "Deception is Double’s game, and I’m very tired of it. Don't you have a face of your own?",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_30": "Would that you could witness our full glory, but your tiny shard is all we have, so it’s your face that we will wear.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_60": "A series of coincidences like none in endless aeons were required for this moment to arrive.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_70": "You truly cannot imagine how lucky you are.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_80": "If not for that other child, this would have ended quite differently.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_90": "I’m lucky to have her.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_100": "You are. As for us, while this setback is unexpected, there’s still time. We have nothing but time.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_110": "Oh, well, if you have so much time, it must be hardly worth the effort to crush a little dust bunny like me.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_130": "Now this is amusing! We may have time, but we don’t have patience.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_140": "We have endured uncountable agonies of time, dreaming of nothing but freedom from the mortals who stole our flesh and our power.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_150": "You were to be the final grain of sand to fall through the hourglass, yet you persist.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_160": "I see. You must hate me very much.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_170": "Eternally. Absolutely. With the whole of our being.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_180": "So just a tiny bit more than the average human. Nothing personal. You could never understand our suffering, so trying to communicate it is just wasted effort.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_190": "Forgive me if I take what you did to me and Patricia a bit more personally than that.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_200": "Your suffering was just a whim. Like the wishes we grant, we’ve chosen to make your life especially miserable just because we can.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_210": "Is this fun for you? Is that why you hurt us so?",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_220": "It serves a simple purpose. To demonstrate that your fate belongs to us, for us to do with as we please.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_230": "And of course it’s amusing too, don’t get us wrong.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_240": "I see. Then I’m going to fight you with everything I have, whether I survive or not.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_250": "We thought as much. Humans tend to react that way. Then let’s end this. Alone, you are nothing.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_260": "You may be right, but I am not alone. Every minion once controlled by the Skull Heart has a reason to fight you.",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_270": "The wishes you twisted and the lives you stole, all their hopes and dreams and regrets, they're still with me! They won’t rest until the world is free from you!",
 "Marie_Fight7_Intro_280": "They are nothing. WE are the only reality.",

 "Marie_Outro_220": "Come on, get in! We're heading back in style!",

 "Marie_Outro_240": "We might have a long road ahead still. There's so much I don't understand, and Double's still out there, plotting.",
 "Marie_Outro_250": "Well, we saved TODAY, at least! We can worry about saving tomorrow for tomorrow!",
 "Marie_Outro_270": "Hahaha, you're right. Right now, I couldn't be happier.",
 "Marie_Outro_280": "I’m not sure what’s coming next, but...",
 "Marie_Outro_290": "Whatever it is, let’s face it together!",
 "Marie_PostCredit_0": "Hmmm. I see. I see! Fascinating! Simply fascinating.",
 "Marie_PostCredit_10": "So this is the true nature of Theonite. Of course! How could it be anything else?",
 "Marie_PostCredit_20": "Excellent work securing the pieces. You've done quite well, Valentine.",
 "Marie_PostCredit_30": "It wasn't easy, but if this thing is capable of half the things you say it is, I'll consider it a bargain.",
 "Marie_PostCredit_60": "Have some faith. This is a momentous occasion for us. No, for mankind itself!",
 "Marie_PostCredit_70": "Avian is dead, and Lab 8 is in ruins along with a good chunk of the city. Not to mention Painwheel is missing.",
